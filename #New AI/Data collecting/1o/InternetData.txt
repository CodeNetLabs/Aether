
=== A ===
A, or a, is the first letter and the first vowel letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, and others worldwide. Its name in English is a (pronounced   AY), plural aes.
It is similar in shape to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version is often written in one of two forms: the double-storey |a| and single-storey |ɑ|. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type.
In English, a is the indefinite article, with the
alternative form an.


== Name ==
In English, the name of the letter is the long A sound, pronounced . Its name in most other languages matches the letter's pronunciation in open syllables.


== History ==
The earliest known ancestor of A is aleph—the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet—where it represented a glottal stop [ʔ], as Phoenician only used  consonantal letters. In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.
When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter representing a glottal stop—so they adapted the sign to represent the vowel /a/, calling the letter by the similar name alpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions dating to the 8th century BC following the Greek Dark Ages, the letter rests upon its side. However, in the later Greek alphabet it generally resembles the modern capital form—though many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.
The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to the Italian Peninsula, and left the form of alpha unchanged. When the Romans adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write Latin, the resulting form used in the Latin script would come to be used to write many  other languages, including English.


=== Typographic variants ===

During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter A. First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other more permanent media. There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the perishable nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule cursive, minuscule cursive, and semi-cursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early semi-uncial (c. 3rd century), the uncial (c. 4th–8th centuries), and the late semi-uncial (c. 6th–8th centuries).

At the end of the Roman Empire (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semi-cursive minuscule of Italy, the Merovingian script in France, the Visigothic script in Spain, and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the ninth century, the Caroline script, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the Italic and Roman forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form ⟨ɑ⟩, also called script a, is often used in handwriting; it consists of a circle with a vertical stroke on its right. In the hands of medieval Irish and English writers, this form gradually developed from a 5th-century form resembling the Greek letter tau ⟨τ⟩. The Roman form ⟨a⟩ is found in most printed material, and consists of a small loop with an arc over it. Both derive from the majuscule form ⟨A⟩. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. Graphic designers refer to the Italic and Roman forms as single-decker a and double decker a respectively.
Italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in Roman type. There are some other cases aside from italic type where script a ⟨ɑ⟩, also called Latin alpha, is used in contrast with Latin ⟨a⟩, such as in the International Phonetic Alphabet.


== Use in writing systems ==


=== English ===

In modern English orthography, the letter ⟨a⟩ represents at least seven different vowel sounds, here represented using the vowels of Received Pronunciation, with effects of ⟨r⟩ ignored and mergers in General American mentioned where relevant:

the near-open front unrounded vowel /æ/ as in pad
the open back unrounded vowel /ɑː/ as in father—merged with /ɒ/ as /ɑ/ in General American—which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound
the open back rounded vowel /ɒ/ (merged with /ɑː/ as /ɑ/ in General American) in was and what
the open-mid back rounded vowel /ɔː/ in water
the diphthong /eɪ/ as in ace and major, usually when ⟨a⟩ is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter—this results from Middle English lengthening followed by the Great Vowel Shift
a schwa /ə/ in many unstressed syllables, as in about, comma, solar
The double ⟨aa⟩ sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as Aaron and aardvark. However, ⟨a⟩ occurs in many common digraphs, all with their own sound or sounds, particularly ⟨ai⟩, ⟨au⟩, ⟨aw⟩, ⟨ay⟩, ⟨ea⟩ and ⟨oa⟩.
⟨a⟩ is the third-most-commonly used letter in English after ⟨e⟩ and ⟨t⟩, as well as in French; it is the second most common in Spanish, and the most common in Portuguese. ⟨a⟩ represents approximately 8.2% of letters as used in English texts; the figure is around 7.6% in French 11.5% in Spanish, and 14.6% in Portuguese.


=== Other languages ===
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, ⟨a⟩ denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as /a/, /ä/, or /ɑ/. An exception is Saanich, in which ⟨a⟩—and the glyph ⟨Á⟩—stands for a close-mid front unrounded vowel /e/.


=== Other systems ===
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, ⟨a⟩ is used for the open front unrounded vowel, ⟨ä⟩ is used for the open central unrounded vowel, and ⟨ɑ⟩ is used for the open back unrounded vowel.
In X-SAMPA, ⟨a⟩ is used for the open front unrounded vowel and ⟨A⟩ is used for the open back unrounded vowel.


== Other uses ==

When using base-16 notation, A or a is the conventional numeral corresponding to the number 10.
In algebra, the letter a along with various other letters of the alphabet is often used to denote a variable, with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics. In 1637, René Descartes "invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x, y, and z, and knowns by a, b, and c", and this convention is still often followed, especially in elementary algebra.
In geometry, capital Latin letters are used to denote objects including line segments, lines, and rays A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.
A is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A−, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; A-list celebrities, A1 at Lloyd's for shipping, etc. Such associations can have a motivating effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.
A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a brassiere.

=== A&A Records ===
A&A Records was a Canadian organization.


== History ==

The company was founded at the end of World War II by Alice Kenner, her husband Mac, with the assistance of her brother, Aaron as A&A Bookstore after Alice and Aaron's first initials, at 351 Yonge Street in a building that had been purchased by Kenner and her husband, Mac. The family also founded the A&A Lunchroom in the same building. In the early 1950s, the store added a record section to sell LP records which were gaining in popularity among young people. Within a few years, record sales became the dominant portion of the store's business. In 1960, A&A Books & Records Company of Canada licensed several franchises across Canada and in 1971, the Kenners sold the business to CBS Records.
In 1974, its operations consisted of the main store at 351 Yonge Street in Toronto, another flagship store on rue Sainte-Catherine in Montreal and six franchise stores in Ontario. The company also had two wholly owned subsidiaries: Glen Music, which had four stores in Alberta, and Glen Music Western, which had six stores in British Columbia.
By the end of 1974, the company decided to close its book business that was located in the basement floor of its flagship store at 351 Yonge Street, Toronto.  The senior management consisted of general manager Rick McGraw and vice-president of marketing R. Bruce Wilson. Its offices were located above the retail store at 351 Yonge Street, in a small portion of the second and third floor.  The second floor was classical department and the third floor was being used as the warehouse. The company itself was a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Records Canada.
In the spring of 1975, the accounting office was relocated to 75 The Donway West, while the management offices remained at 351 Yonge Street.
In 1981 CBS sold its retail and wholesale pre-recorded music business to some of its former executives - Terry Lynd, Fred Rich and Dick Moody, who took over the company as Chairman, President and Executive Vice-President respectively and collectively held majority ownership.  The corporate name under the new ownership was Sound Insight Limited, while retail stores kept the trade name A&A Records and Tapes, and later A&A Music & Entertainment.
Between 1981 and 1987, the company made several acquisitions including the purchase of Flipside retail chain from Polydor Records.
In 1987 the company reported its best financial results - sales of $134 million and net income of over $7 million.  That same year, Sound Insight was purchased by a group of Canadian and US investors and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Vector No. Acquisition Corporation. The company's operations had previously been confined to fewer than forty stores, but during this period the company went through a period of rapid expansion, opening almost 100 new retail stores during 1989 alone.
By 1990, A&A had 260 retail stores across Canada, twice as many as their chief competitor Sam The Record Man, and had a presence in every province. The company's sudden expansion, however, proved to be its undoing: many of the new locations were opened with no cohesive marketing strategy, and almost all of the new locations proved to be unprofitable and unsustainable.
During peak Christmas season in 1990, company's sales were $400,000 to $600,000 below breakeven.  Senior management discussed several options to stabilize the business.  After staggering through two further unprofitable years, it was decided that CCAA filing was the only viable option.
The corporation filed for protection under the Company Creditors Arrangement Act in January 1993.


== Bankruptcy ==
The chain—having shed most of their unprofitable stores—emerged from bankruptcy under the ownership of Lincoln Capital Corporation.  However, the corporation again filed for bankruptcy later in 1993, and was dissolved when its assets were sold piecemeal.  Its remaining retail outlets were absorbed by other retailers, with many of the remaining A&A stores being absorbed into the Music World or Sunrise Records chains.
In December 1993, the flagship Yonge Street store became a Future Shop, which later relocated to the nearby 10 Dundas East complex. The location was sold to Ryerson Polytechnic University (now Toronto Metropolitan University), and the building torn down in 2010, along with A&A's former rival - the nearby Sam the Record Man flagship store.

=== A&B Sound ===
A&B Sound was a Canadian company.


== History ==
A&B Sound was founded by Fred Steiner in 1959. The first store was located at 571 Granville St., and in 1970 it moved to 556 Seymour Street. The store initially sold televisions, stereos and radio equipment, adding music later that year.


=== Expansion throughout British Columbia ===
A second store opened in 1977 in Victoria, British Columbia in a building once used as that city's first hospital, and later as a brothel. This building is now home to a number of businesses and the University of Victoria's poverty law clinic, known as the Law Centre.  In 1980, the company's Vancouver location expanded to three floors, followed in 1981 by the construction of a new store on Hastings Street, near the border of Burnaby. A fourth location opened in 1984 on South West Marine Drive in Vancouver.
Fred Steiner retired in 1987, and his son Nick became president of A&B Sound. New stores subsequently opened in Surrey (1987), Burnaby's Metrotown area (1988), and Nanaimo (1990). Fred Steiner died in 1991, the same year that the East Hastings location moved into a larger property at the corner of Hastings Street and the Trans Canada Highway, close to the PNE Playland. The following year, an eighth store opened in Kelowna.


=== Expansion into Western Canada ===
In 1993, A&B Sound moved into the Alberta market, opening locations in Calgary and Edmonton, followed by south Edmonton (1994), a second Calgary location (1995), Lethbridge (1996), and Red Deer and a third Calgary outlet in autumn 1998. Also in 1995, a store was opened in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Expansion continued throughout Western Canada, with new stores in Regina and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (1999) and Winnipeg, Manitoba (2000). In 2001, Nick Steiner stepped aside as president, retaining his role as chairman, and long-time CEO Tim Howley became president and CEO. A number of locations, such as those in Calgary, also included bookstore sections, though by the start of the 2000s decade most of these sections had been removed.


=== Impact on Vancouver's record, tape and CD retail industry ===
For years, A&B Sound maintained a reputation in the western Canadian music market for having the lowest prices and best selection on records, cassettes, and later, CDs. Often, the chain would out-price other major retailers, including A&A Records and Tapes, as well as Toronto-based Sam the Record Man, which was unable to penetrate the Vancouver market with as much success as it had in eastern Canada. A downtown Vancouver location of Sam the Record Man was located next door to A&B Sound's Seymour Street location until late in 2000, when it was closed. In a 1993 article in The Georgia Straight newspaper, it is noted that A&B Sound's aggressive pricing policies resulted in Vancouver having the lowest record prices of any Canadian metropolis. These low prices were not only blamed for the failures of other chains, but may have been one reason for some chains not opening stores in Vancouver, including Tower Records, which had scouted Vancouver as a possible location to expand into Canada. When HMV finally opened stores in the Vancouver area in 1993, HMV Canada's then-president, Paul Alofs, said that breaking into the Vancouver market would be difficult. "A&B is certainly a very strong competitor, and we have a lot of respect for what they do."


=== Bankruptcy and a new owner ===
In the 1990s and 2000s decade, A&B began to face increasing competition for music, DVD and electronics sales. Vancouver-based Future Shop added music to its product mix, using the same aggressive pricing structure it did with consumer electronics. Besides HMV, other retail giants including  Wal-Mart and Best Buy entered the marketplace as well, the latter having purchased Future Shop in the early 2000s decade. In early 2005, with a debt of C$57 million, A&B Sound filed for protection under Canadian bankruptcy regulations. A sale to American company Sun Capital Partners Group Inc. was announced, but this sale was not approved by A&B's creditors. Instead, the company was purchased by Canadian computer manufacturer Seanix Technology Inc., based in Richmond and led by Paul Girard. He announced that they planned to close down or relocate some of the branches that were losing money and focus on the BC and Alberta markets. That year and the next, a number of employees were laid off, and several locations were closed, including both the Winnipeg stores in 2005, the Hastings Street store in January 2006, and in August 2006, their Red Deer, Regina, and Saskatoon locations. Its high-profile Downtown Calgary store was also closed in February 2005, although that city maintained locations in the northeast and deep south. Meanwhile, new locations were opened in the city of North Vancouver and Pitt Meadows, while the Kelowna, south Calgary, and Surrey stores were relocated. In March 2007, the Downtown Edmonton location closed, with plans to re-open another Edmonton location in the works. The Burnaby location was also closed around this time. On December 15, 2007, a new location opened in Langford (near Victoria). On January 4, 2008, the Delta store, which had re-located from Surrey, was closed. In early 2008, A&B was planning to open a new store in Chilliwack, located not far from the local Future Shop. In July 2008, all signs for this location were removed, and plans for the Chilliwack location were scrapped.


=== Store closures and second bankruptcy ===
On April 3, 2008, it was announced the historic Victoria location would close. On April 8, 2008, A&B Sound said that it would be joining the Audiotronic chain, but nothing further came of this.
On July 23, 2008, management made the decision to close the Nanaimo location. Several days later, on July 29, 2008, the decision was made to abruptly close the once-profitable Calgary North location as well, leaving A&B with no remaining presence in Calgary, as the south location had been dismantled a few months earlier after only a year in its new location. Employees and management at both branches were greeted to a locked front door and a message stating that the location had been shut down, with no prior notice.
Over the next few months, the remainder of the A&B Sound chain collapsed, with its remaining branches closing on the following dates:

August 12, 2008 - Shutdown of the two remaining Vancouver stores, Seymour and Marine Drive.
August 29, 2008 - Langley, B.C. (Greater Vancouver).
September 18, 2008 - Pitt Meadows.
October 23, 2008 - The South Edmonton and Abbotsford store were closed, although both re-opened briefly later in the week for liquidation sales.
November 7, 2008 - The last remaining A&B Sound store in North Vancouver closes.
The collapse of A&B Sound was predicted by retail analysts during the summer of 2008. Retail Analyst David Ian Gray was quoted as saying, "I think they're done. They had to close stores, for sure, but they're getting to a point where their brand is lost, and I just don't see them being able to restart it." A&B, on its website, wrote a letter to its employees and customers stating that they had to restructure their business to work in today's market, so the business itself believed it would continue on.  However, A&B dropped its A&B credit card from Wells Fargo October 15, 2008, and as expected, no replacement was issued.
On November 7, 2008, A&B Sound officially announced that it had gone out of business, joining a number of other now-defunct Canadian music chains, including A&A Records and Sam the Record Man.
Since the final store closed in late 2008, A&B Sound's remaining inventory was in limbo, with a briefly advertised sale in its Abbotsford location cancelled without explanation.  However, in late June 2011, the inventory resurfaced; Able Auctions in Vancouver was liquidating the remaining stock on Saturday, June 25.

=== Former Routes ===


==== Bergen Avenue Route ====
Prior to A&C Bus Corporation's operation of the Bergen Avenue route, the route was operated by Bergen Avenue IBOA.  When Bergen Avenue IBOA was unable to make an insurance payment, it abruptly stopped running its only route on March 12, 2011, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) granted emergency operating authority to A&C Bus Corporation.  A&C Bus Corporation began operating the route on March 16, 2011, with no changes in bus fares, however it reduced operating hours to 6:30AM–10:00PM (running every half-hour).  Since that time, the owners of Bergen Avenue IBOA stated that it intended on selling the rights to operate the route, however the NJDOT stated the company's rights ceased when it abruptly stopped operating with no warning to passengers.


==== Route 4 ====

Prior to A&C Bus Corporation's assuming operations Route 4 was run by Red & Tan in Hudson County, which discontinued service on November 6, 2011. A&C Bus began operating the route between Greenville and Newport Centre Mall shortly after. It discontinued service on March 2, 2019, citing low ridership. New Jersey Transit route 86 was extended to replace part of the route. NJ Transit Route 1 was also rerouted to replace some of the former Route 4 service along Communipaw and Pacific Avenues beginning on June 22, 2019.

=== A&E (TV network) ===
A&E, an initialism of its original name (the Arts & Entertainment Network), is an American cable and satellite television network and the flagship property of A&E Networks, a joint venture between Hearst Communications and the Walt Disney Company (through the Disney General Entertainment Content division of Disney Entertainment). A&E was launched on February 1, 1984, as a block on Nickelodeon. The network originally focused on fine arts, documentaries, dramas, and educational entertainment. Today, it deals primarily in non-fiction programming, including reality television, true crime, documentaries and miniseries, thus de-emphasizing its full name in the process. 
Since 1985, it is no longer a programming block, due to its joint owners spinning it off into a 24-hour channel while Nickelodeon later launched Nick at Nite to fill in the time slot A&E formerly held. As of November 2023, A&E is available to approximately 63,000,000 pay television households in the United States – down from its 2011 peak of 100,000,000 households. The American version of the channel is being distributed in Canada while international versions were launched for Australia, Latin America, and Europe.


== History ==


=== 1984–2002 ===

A&E launched on February 1, 1984, initially available to 9.3 million cable television homes in the U.S. and Canada. The network is a result of the 1984 merger of Hearst/ABC's Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS) and (pre–General Electric merger) RCA-owned The Entertainment Channel.
It was originally available in two versions, one in an 8-hour version, which was to follow Nickelodeon on RCA Satcom III-R, the other was a full 20-hour version, on another satellite provider, the Westar V. In 1984, the signal split off from Nickelodeon, once A&E picked up its 20-hour signal on RCA Satcom III-R. In response, Nickelodeon launched its own nighttime block Nick at Nite to displace A&E on many signals.
In 1986, the network premiered one of the first classical music videos to be broadcast in the United States and Canada, the Kendall Ross Bean: Chopin Polonaise in A Flat.
By 1990, original programming accounted for 35 to 40 percent of A&E's content. Biography, a one-hour documentary series that was revived in 1987, was considered to be the network's signature show. In 1994, airings of Biography went from weekly broadcasts to airing five nights a week, which helped boost A&E's ratings to record levels. The nightly series became A&E's top-rated show and one of cable television's most notable successes. Biography received Primetime Emmy Awards in 1999 and 2002.
In 1993, Rockefeller Group’s Radio City Music Hall sold its 12.5% stake of A&E to Capital Cities/ABC, Hearst & NBC, NBC owns 25% stake of A&E, while the others 37.5% stake of the two. In 1994, the channel picked up reruns of Law & Order on an eight-year agreement, which would help bring in additional viewers.
In May 1995, the channel's name officially changed to the A&E Network, to reflect its declining focus on arts and entertainment. The following year, the network had branded itself as simply A&E, using the slogans "Time Well Spent" and in 1998, "Escape the Ordinary." "The word 'arts,' in regard to television, has associations such as 'sometimes elitist,' 'sometimes boring,' 'sometimes overly refined' and 'doesn't translate well to TV,'" Whitney Goit, executive vice president for sales and marketing, stated. "Even the arts patron often finds arts on TV not as satisfying as it should be ... And the word 'entertainment' is too vague. Therefore, much like ESPN uses its letters rather than what they stand for – Entertainment Sports (Programming) Network – we decided to go to just A&E." Of the network's tagline, Goit said, "Intellectually, 'Time well spent' defines a comparison between those who view a lot of television as a wasteland, and their acknowledgment that there are good things on TV and that they'd like to watch more thought-provoking TV."
A&E and Meridian Broadcasting commissioned Horatio Hornblower (1999), winner of two Primetime Emmy Awards, and the seven subsequent dramas in the series; Dash and Lilly (1999), which received nine Emmy nominations; and The Crossing (2000), which won the Peabody Award. The network created two original weekly drama series, Sidney Lumet's 100 Centre Street and Nero Wolfe, both of which lasted from 2001 to 2002.


=== 2002–2013 ===
In 2002, the contract for Law and Order had expired with the renewal asking price at four times the original per episode fee. Dropping that show allowed the channel to move to more "brand-defining scripted and nonfiction series." That same year, A&E would shift its focus toward reality television in order to attract a younger demographic and cancelled the network's two original scripted series. In May 2003, A&E launched a marketing campaign with the network's new tagline, "The Art of Entertainment." Between 2003 and 2007, the channel gradually retired several long-running series, moving several shows to The Biography Channel and introducing new reality programming. In 2005, A&E launched their feature film production arm A&E IndieFilms.
The docudrama Flight 93, about the hijacking of the plane which crashed in Pennsylvania during the September 11 attacks, was the most watched program on the network; it attracted 5.9 million viewers for its initial telecast on January 30, 2006. This was later surpassed by Duck Dynasty's third season premiere. The previous record-holder for the network was a World War II docudrama, Ike: Countdown to D-Day, starring Tom Selleck and broadcast in 2004, with 5.5 million viewers. A&E later acquired rights to rerun the HBO series The Sopranos; its A&E premiere on January 10, 2007, averaged 3.86 million viewers, making it the most-watched premiere of a rerun off-network series in cable television history at the time. The series continued to perform well for A&E, and led the network to regularly rank in the top ten basic U.S. cable channels in prime time ratings.
On May 26, 2008, in conjunction with the premiere of the original film The Andromeda Strain, A&E rebranded with a new logo and slogan, Real Life. Drama., representing its shift to a more contemporary network with a focus on scripted programming. Additional shows in this major scripted push were drama series The Cleaner and The Beast, which both lasted two seasons. A&E ordered several dramas for Fall 2009, including projects from Jerry Bruckheimer, Shawn Ryan and Lynda Obst, and a Western miniseries from Kevin Costner. On July 10, 2012, NBCUniversal announced it would sell 15.8% stake of A&E Networks to Disney and Hearst, making the company a 50-50 joint venture.


=== 2013–present ===
On December 11, 2013, A&E unveiled a new on-air brand identity built around the slogan "Be Original", emphasizing the network's lineup of original productions and positioning it as a "much lighter, more fun place to come and spend time". The success of Duck Dynasty, Bates Motel and Storage Wars put A&E fourth in 2013 among cable channels in the key 18-to-49 age demographic.
On February 20, 2014, A&E Networks UK announced a UK version of the channel to launch on Sky channel 168 on March 24, with a Virgin Media launch date planned for next year. In Spain and Portugal, the channel was launched on October 1, 2014, replacing The Biography Channel in that market.
In 2015, A&E picked up the CBS drama Unforgettable for a fourth season as well as the second season of docuseries Married at First Sight, which will move from sister network FYI. The network also announced the revival of Intervention following its cancellation in 2013.
In October 2016, A&E premiered Live PD, a live series that followed U.S. police departments on patrol in real-time. The show would quickly garner commercial success; in 2018, a survey by Inscape found Live PD to be the most-watched program among non-live (DVR and VOD) and over-the-top viewers in 2018. Live PD was among the most-watched programs on cable television during its run and was credited for allowing A&E to reverse the trend of systematic viewership declines seen across cable television networks.
On January 19, 2017, A&E announced a reboot of Cold Case Files, over a decade after its final season premiered in 2006. A revival of the Biography franchise would also launch on June 28, 2017, with The Notorious Life of Biggie Smalls.
In June 2020, Live PD was cancelled by the network in the wake of the 2020 race riots and after reports were confirmed that the show's producers had recorded and then deleted footage of the killing of Javier Ambler under police custody. The footage was erased after the Austin Police Department conducted an investigation using the body cam footage they had from the officers. While defending the show in a statement, Dan Abrams said, "Contrary to many incorrect reports, neither A&E nor the producers of 'Live PD' were asked for the footage or an interview by investigators from law enforcement or the District Attorney's office." A&E over-reliance on the series to fill its schedule resulted in the network losing half of its audience; up until that point, A&E's primetime viewership had been up by 4% year-over-year.
In 2021, A&E began a partnership with the professional wrestling promotion WWE to develop original content chronicling the company's history and performers, including eight episodes of Biography focusing on WWE figures, and WWE's Most Wanted Treasures—a series following Stephanie McMahon and Paul "Triple H" Levesque in their search of wrestling memorabilia. Most Wanted Treasures was A&E's most-watched new series in 2021, while the premiere of a Biography episode on Stone Cold Steve Austin attracted the franchise's highest viewership in 16 years. In 2022, WWE and A&E announced a 24-episode renewal for Most Wanted Treasures, an additional 35 Biography: WWE Legends episodes, and the new series WWE Rivals. Rivals was renewed for a second season that premiered in February 2023, alongside the third season of Biography: WWE Legends. In December 2024, WWE announced a new reality series—WWE LFG—to premiere in 2025, as well as the new documentary series WWE's Greatest Moments and renewals for WWE Rivals.

Notable original series seen on A&E have included Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, Breakfast with the Arts, The First 48, Duck Dynasty, Intervention, Live PD, Storage Wars, and Wahlburgers.


=== Original and co-produced movies and miniseries ===


== Criticism and controversy ==


=== Secrets of Playboy ===
Beginning in January 2022, A&E broadcast a 12-part series entitled "Secrets of Playboy."  This included allegations that Hugh Hefner himself had committed rape and sexual assault.  The show also included claims that other men in the Playboy orbit, such as Bill Cosby, had committed rape. One of the women coming forward was Sondra Theodore, Hefner's girlfriend in the late 1970s and early '80s.  She stated that many people in fact believed the reports and accusations, but tended to blame the women anyway because of the reputation of the Playboy Mansion, even though Playboy tried to put forward a healthy "Girl Next Door" attitude. This A&E series also include claims by Dr. Mark Saginor's estranged daughter, by Theodore, and by former butler Mitch Rosen that the doctor was not only Hefner's live-in physician, but also his male lover. Dr. Saginor said this was not the case.
Some Playboy employees signed a statement which read: “ . . Our time within Hugh Hefner's Playboy and the organization's subsidiaries remains a period all of us are fond of. I proudly sign this letter in recognition of Hugh Hefner's character amid unfounded allegations in the A&E show.” In response, A&E issued a statement which read: “The stories shared in Secrets of Playboy are the personal experiences of the documentary's participants and deserve to be told despite how difficult they may be for some to hear. Signatures on a letter, or a different experience with Mr. Hefner or the Playboy culture, do not negate the experiences of those who have come forward . . ”


=== Longmire ===
The 2014 cancellation of Longmire drew viewer backlash over the network citing that the show skewed an older audience as one of the reasons. The series was later picked up by Netflix.


=== Duck Dynasty ===
On December 19, 2013, A&E attempted to place Phil Robertson from Duck Dynasty on an indefinite hiatus following remarks on homosexuals in an interview with GQ. A&E said in a statement, "We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty. His personal views in no way reflect those of A+E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community." On December 27, 2013, A&E announced they would begin filming again with the entire Robertson family after an outcry from show viewers and discussions with the Robertson family and numerous advocacy groups, a decision which itself resulted in more criticism of the network for refusing to stand by its original statement.


=== Nero Wolfe ===
Earlier, A&E had been criticized for extreme channel drift from its original focus on the fine arts. For example, Maury Chaykin reflected on the cancellation of the A&E original series A Nero Wolfe Mystery in a 2008 interview: "I'm a bit jaded and cynical about which shows succeed on television. I worked on a fantastic show once called Nero Wolfe, but at the time A&E was transforming from the premiere intellectual cable network in America to one that airs Dog the Bounty Hunter on repeat, so it was never promoted and eventually went off the air."

=== A&E (song) ===
"A&E" is a song by English electronic music duo Goldfrapp from their fourth studio album, Seventh Tree (2008). The song was written and produced by Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory, with co-production handled by Flood. It was released as the album's lead single on 11 February 2008.


== Background and writing ==
"A&E" was composed as a collaborative effort between Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory in 2007 in a recording studio near Somerset, England. Its lyrics were inspired by Goldfrapp's visit to the emergency department of a hospital on a Saturday afternoon. The doctors "pumped [her] up with loads of painkillers" and she described the situation as a "bit surreal." 
Writing for Pitchfork, Matthew Perpetua interpreted the song's storyline as "showcase for both her lyrical and vocal strengths...from the perspective of an incredibly lonely woman driven to a suicide attempt while waiting around for a phone call from a man she's not even sure she likes." 
In 2023, Goldfrapp commented "it’s so autobiographical. It’s not fantastical at all, it’s kind of [about] what happened. You know, I was in A&E in a hospital gown having a bit of a meltdown. So it does feel slightly odd now when I sing it."


== Critical reception ==
"A&E" received positive reviews from music critics. John Murphy of musicOMH called the song "a beautifully paced ballad, with a memorable hook [...] which buries its way into your head after just a couple of listens". Digital Spy reviewer Nick Levine described "A&E" as "lush, folky and [...] organic" and wrote that Goldfrapp's vocals were "full of longing and slow-burning sexuality". Popjustice described the song as "fucking brilliant". Alex Denney of Drowned in Sound was less impressed, writing that "the sparks [...] fail to fly".
The song appeared at number 73 on Pitchfork's "The 100 Best Tracks of 2008" list.


== Commercial performance ==
"A&E" debuted at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending 16 February 2008. The following week the song reached its peak position at number 10 and spent nine weeks on the chart. Elsewhere, the track saw modest chart success. "A&E" debuted and peaked at number 33 on the Irish Singles Chart, while reaching number 38 in Belgium, number 85 in Australia number 98 in Germany.
The single reached number 65 on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. It also reached number 12 on the Euro Digital Tracks chart and number 14 on the Euro Digital Songs chart. In the United States, "A&E" reached number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart and number two on Hot Singles Sales chart.


== Music video ==
The music video for "A&E" was directed by Dougal Wilson which, in sharp contrast to the song's hospital theming, is more nature-themed. The video is set in a forest and opens with Goldfrapp in a white dress lying in a clearing, looking up at the camera. She is soon joined by several leaf-men who dance around her as she sings. Midway through the video, day turns into night and Goldfrapp is joined by several woodland creatures. The video concludes with Gregory playing a guitar and making tea beside an orange tent.
The video premiered on 12 January 2008 on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. In a review for Drowned in Sound, Alex Denney described the video as "weird" and compared it to music videos by Kate Bush and The Mighty Boosh. Pitchfork reviewer Marc Hogan wrote that the video was a "good fit for Goldfrapp's bright, folksy turn" and praised its "twist ending".

=== A&E Records ===
A&E Records is a United Kingdom-based record label imprint, owned by Warner Music Group (WMG). It operates under the WEA International group of labels at WMG.
A&E Records was formalised in May 2003, when the NewsCorp Music Group of independent record labels (comprising Mushroom Records UK, Infectious Records, Ultimate Dilemma, Perfecto and 48K) were absorbed into WMG's East West after 20 months of negotiations, with all of its roster transferring over. In November 2004, A&E Records was realigned, and transferred across the company to within the Warner Bros label.


== History ==
A&E Records was formalised on 19 May 2003, with all of Mushroom Records UK and Infectious' artist roster transferring over to the East West imprint, including its new signings The Darkness, Funeral for a Friend and Freeform Five, while Korda Marshall took up the position of managing director with the label. WMG completed its acquisition of Mushroom Records for around $15m (£9.2m) and East West absorbed the functions of Mushroom, which was closed the week prior. East West immediately re-issued its new artists back catalogue albums through A&E Records and Warner Strategic Marketing distribution.
The following year, from 25 June 2004, East West was subject to the rebranding as one of WMG's two frontline UK labels, changing to Atlantic Records (the other label WEA London becoming Warner Bros). On 14 November of that year, Marshall became managing director of Warner Bros. A&E Records was realigned, and transferred across the company to Warner Bros. The Infectious brand name and logo also transferred from Atlantic, along with Ash, Garbage and Muse.
A&E Records has continued to release records by Garbage (until 2007) and Timo Maas and to release Muse records through sub-label Helium 3. The role of Infectious within Warner Bros has been decreased and not including Ash releases, is being used for launching newly signed acts such as The Subways and Larrikin Love. Former parent Festival Mushroom Records was acquired by WMG on 21 October 2005 and its labels and artists absorbed into Warner Music Australia, however none of those artists have been transferred to A&E Records.

== Mushroom Records UK ==
Mushroom Records UK was set up in London in 1993 by Gary Ashley, as an offshoot of the Australian independent label Mushroom Records, which had been formed in 1972 by Michael Gudinski and Ray Evans in Melbourne. Mushroom Records UK was intended mainly to serve the UK with Australian musical imports. Marshall had previously been RCA's head of A&R, and had left the company to establish his own Infectious Records which he aligned under Mushroom Records UK.
The label's first worldwide signing was US rock group Garbage, who became the flagship for the label, achieving multi-million sales with their first album release. Concerned that they were only known in the United Kingdom for the Neighbours theme (composed by Mushroom Music Publishing), to move away from the association, Mushroom founded the Discordant label for the sole purpose of launching Garbage. Although following their debut single, Garbage were reconciled with the main label, a few Australian acts such as Garageland and Deadstar were licensed to Discordant.
Mushroom had early success with Australian singer Peter Andre, while retaining a diverse roster signing UK acts such as The Wildhearts, and importing Australian acts such as Deni Hines, Christian Fry, Ween, Antenna, Sister2Sister, VAST and Yothu Yindi. Several acts were signed to Infectious Records, including Ash, Symposium, My Vitriol, Cable, Seafood, Elevator Suite and Pop Will Eat Itself, while Mushroom licensed local signing Muse from Taste Media. Sub labels Perfecto had successes with Paul Oakenfold and offshoot label 48K artist Timo Maas; sister label Ultimate Dilemma also had Zero 7, Magnet and Roots Manuva on its books. In 1999, Mushroom Records UK was one of only two labels who wanted to sign singer Kylie Minogue (ultimately she chose to sign to Parlophone).
With these acts charting highly brought Mushroom to the front stage of music in the UK, with an initial £5,000 turnover increasing to £23m over its 10 years, however Marshall began to extricate Mushroom UK from the Mushroom family during 2001, after the parent company had been sold in 1999 to Rupert Murdoch's Newscorp, and merged with his Festival Records to form Festival Mushroom Records. Mushroom Records UK was slowly wound down as negotiations crystallised; its last release was the Garbage single "Shut Your Mouth" in September 2002.

=== A&F Quarterly ===
A&F Quarterly was an American lifestyle periodical by Abercrombie & Fitch.
The magazine to serve as a promotional vehicle, being targeted towards the college-aged youth (18–22). Its contents prominently feature photo spreads by A&F photographer Bruce Weber and also encompassed a variety of articles on lifestyle, sex, entertainment, travel, dining, and celebrity interviews.
The Quarterly's inclusion of nudity and sexuality has been a continual controversial topic. Positive criticism during its initial American run (1997–2003) called it an ingenious marketing tool, the envy of the publishing world, which "redefined the All-American look for teenagers." Negative criticism summarized the catalog as "soft porn" and racy. There were numerous lawsuits and boycotts focusing on moral and religious grounds which included the National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families, the American Decency Association, and the Focus on the Family organization.
Abercrombie & Fitch discontinued A&F Quarterly in 2003, and later resurfaced it as a one-time limited edition exclusively for the European market (2008). A&F Quarterly returned in 2010 as an element for the Back-to-School marketing campaign, becoming the first issue sold simultaneously worldwide.
During its American publication, circulation reached a peak of 1.2 million. The Quarterly had a distribution of about 200,000 copies through sales in Abercrombie & Fitch stores (at US$6.00 a copy) and subscriptions ($12.00 a year). Advertisements for A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone, and Vanity Fair.


== Original American run (1997-2003) ==


=== Initial launch of the "magalog" ===
Abercrombie & Fitch introduced A&F Quarterly as a marketing tool to express the A&F lifestyle. The Quarterly was meant to further establish the image of Abercrombie & Fitch as synonymous with sex and youth: The "neo-preppy and all-American perfection." The publication was coined a "magalog" for its purpose of serving as both a magazine and a catalog for the A&F brand. Its contents focused on entertaining, and giving advice to, the collegiate youth with an emphasis of having youthful fun and exploring sexuality.
The company collaborated with prominent figures in the fashion marketing world to produce the publication: Savas Abadsidis, Sam Shahid, and Bruce Weber. Weber had been recognized before for his erotic beefcake photography, and Shahid was notable for his Brooke Shields' "Nothing comes between me and my Calvins" Calvin Klein and his Banana Republic's "Free Souls" campaign. The two had previously worked together at Calvin Klein. For the Quarterly, Abadsidis served as editor-in-chief, Shahid as creative director, and Weber as exclusive photographer. Weber splashed A&F Quarterly with nudity (though non-frontal) and erotic heterosexuality and homosexuality.
A&F Quarterly made its debut in June 1997 and quickly became popular. Subsequent publications were released on a quarterly basis, one for each Abercrombie & Fitch fashion season ("Spring Break", "Summer", "Back-to-School", and "Christmas"). The first issue was considered relatively tame, with subsequent publications becoming more and more explicit. Abercrombie & Fitch stores required over-age proof and obscured cover nudity; nonetheless, parents complained that the publication found its way to younger-aged children.
A&F spokesperson Hampton Carney said, "it is beautiful fashion photography. It's clean, sexy, and we think our customers will really love it."


=== A&F vs American Eagle ===
In June 1998, Abercrombie & Fitch filed a lawsuit against rival clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging that "AE impermissibly copied the designs of certain articles of clothing, in-store advertising displays, and a catalog [A&F Quarterly]." In July 1999, the court granted American Eagle's motion for summary judgment in its favor.
According to A&F's initial complaint, the company identified A&F Quarterly as one of its "unique and inherently distinctive features"

the creation of a cutting edge "cool" image through photographs and advertising and promotional material, such as the A&F Quarterly (the "catalog" or "Quarterly"). The Quarterly presents the Abercrombie brand and trade dress in a unique manner: namely, it features the Abercrombie brand and trade dress in a "cutout" or "clothesline" style [as opposed to only depicting models wearing its apparel] and uses color bars to illustrate the available colors of the item, while combining a consistent conceptual theme with a lifestyle editorial content of music, electronics, books, and magazine features. The catalog is printed on cougar vellum paper, which is unique for a catalog.
The district court ruled that what A&F described as its distinctive trade dress was (in the words of the appellate court) "too generic and descriptive" to warrant protection under the Lanham Act. A&F appealed this judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which again ruled for American Eagle. The court stated that "Abercrombie's clothing designs and in-store presentations are legally functional non-protectable trade dress and that Abercrombie could not possibly have carried its burden of proving that American's catalog was confusingly similar to what we have presumed is the protectable trade dress of Abercrombie's Quarterly."
The Court of Appeals, in the course of comparing the two stores' catalogs, described the Quarterly as follows:

Abercrombie uses grainy images of exceptionally fit and attractive young people in outdoor (often collegiate) settings, alone and in groups, wearing more or less A&F clothing in ways that convey their allegiance to the brand while also seemingly attempting to create a sexual mystique about the wearer....Throughout the Quarterly, A&F makes extensive use of photographs depicting apparently college-aged people in often erotic or homoerotic poses or situations wearing clothes with A&F logos displayed more or less prominently. A&F works with noted fashion photographer Bruce Weber, whose style is well-known in the industry and recognizable by even the uninitiated.
The court concluded that although the above characteristics distinguished the Quarterly from AE's catalog,

No rational trier of fact could conclude that the overall appearances created by the configuration of the two catalogs are similar....There is so little danger of a consumer picking up the two catalogs and not quickly realizing that they emanate from different sources that judgment as a matter of law for American Eagle is appropriate.


=== Mounting protest and concern ===
Mothers Against Drunk Driving spoke out against the Quarterly after its 1998 "Back-to-School" issue featured alcoholic drink recipes (with names such as "Brain Hemorrhage") and instructions for a drinking game. The Center for Science in the Public Interest also protested the "Drinking 101" promotion, which advised: "Rather than the standard beer binge, indulge in some creative drinking this semester." The article included recipes for ten mixed drinks and a spinner featuring pictures of each drink, intended to be used in various drinking games. Abercrombie & Fitch ordered the drinking game pages removed from its stores' remaining copies and sent apology letters to its subscribers.
In 1999, Illinois lieutenant governor Corinne Wood called for a consumer boycott of Abercrombie & Fitch because of the sexually explicit nature of the Quarterly's "Naughty or Nice" holiday issue, which included nude photographs and an interview with porn star Jenna Jameson. Among the images that stirred controversy was a picture of Santa and Mrs. Claus engaging in sadomasochistic behavior, across the page from the statement "Sometimes it's good to be bad." The Illinois Coalition of Sexual Assault assisted the boycott. That same year, Michigan attorney general (and later governor) Jennifer Granholm sent a letter to the company complaining that the holiday catalog contained sexual material that could not be distributed to minors under Michigan law. The catalog featured an A&F "sexpert" who offered advice on "sex for three" and told readers willing to "go down" on a date at the movies that it was acceptable, "just so long as you do not disturb those around you." Four states threatened legal action over the issue.
In 2001, cultural conservatives and anti-porn feminists called for a boycott of A&F over the Summer 2001 issue of A&F Quarterly, which included photographs of naked or near-naked young people frolicking on the beach. The images also included top-naked young women and rear-naked young men on top of each other. The head of Concerned Christians of America said, "The exploitation of sex and young people in A&F's catalog is not only atrocious but also a psychological molestation of their teen-age customers." The National Organization for Women criticized the catalog for promoting "unrealistic body types" and displaying images that simulate group sex. The catalog included an interview with porn star Ron Jeremy, who discussed performing oral sex on himself and using a dildo cast from his own penis.
The Back-to-School 2001 issue (subtitled The Brightest) featured a fictitious A&F University backdrop. Photos of women splashing naked in a fountain were inspired by Katharine Hepburn's supposed skinny-dipping at Bryn Mawr College. Another set was inspired by a UC Berkeley student that spent a day nude in class. The typical protest followed the release.
No issues were distributed during the Christmas season following the September 11 attacks, because the company felt the tone of the publication was not suitable for the mood at that time.
Creative Director Sam Shahid generated more criticism with his January 2003 statement: "We don't buckle under to criticism. We feel we're right about what we're doing, I'm not out to hurt anybody and nobody is damaged by any of this."


=== Non-A&F advertisements ===
Shahid stated that A&F had been thinking about providing commercial space in A&F Quarterly for a long time. The company finally made four spreads available in the Summer 2002 issue, which were bought by Sony Computer Entertainment (for the PlayStation 2 video game console), SoBe, The WB Television Network (promoting Smallville, which starred previous A&F model Tom Welling), and Trek Bicycle Corporation. Spokesmen for WB told The New York Times that they found it intriguing and took the ad space because A&F assured they would be the only television advertiser. Spokeswomen for SoBe called the Quarterly a "good fit" because SoBe targets the same age group as A&F.


=== The decision to discontinue ===
For Christmas 2003, Abercrombie & Fitch released its most controversial Quarterly yet. It was 280 pages and was subtitled David Abercrombie & Ezra Fitch's Christmas Field Guide. The cover proclaimed in bold letters, "280 pages of moose, ice hockey, chivalry, group sex and more." The inside features discussed tips for oral sex and displayed images of group sex and nude young adults frolicking in a river. Included was a letter from the editor which read: "We don't want much this year, but in keeping with the spirit, we'd like to ask forgiveness from some of the people we've offended over the years....If you'd be so kind, please offer our apologies to the following: the Catholic League, former Lt. Governor Corrine Wood of Illinois, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Stanford University Asian American Association, N.O.W." The reaction was an unprecedented wave of strong protest. While protest  was mounting, a former model revealed that subjects unwilling to go nude were dismissed by Weber and Shahid, and that Weber constantly pressured them to "act sexier". A Quarterly contributor remarked, "They're [A&F] all about crossing the lines, but this time they drew a line in the sand. They were kind of asking for it."
On December 9, 2003, Abercrombie & Fitch announced its decision to withdraw the issue and to end the publication, stating that the Christmas issue would be its last. Chairman and CEO Mike Jeffries stated that he ended the Quarterly because he was "bored" with it. A company spokesperson said that "we just felt it was time to retire it and come back with something that has beautiful imagery and classical photos." Another statement from the company said that "while [A&F] has enjoyed success with the quarterly over the years, the company believes it is time for new thinking and looks forward to unveiling an innovative and exciting campaign in the spring." Copies were removed from store shelves, and the remainder were distributed only to subscribers.
A&F had finished shooting for A&F Quarterly Spring 2004 in Rome in October 2003.


==== Reactions ====
There were many reports that the editor-in-chief Savas Abadsidis was "quietly" fired a week before December 9. The reason told was that there had been "creative differences over the Quarterly's next step." A&F executives hoped that the controversy over the Christmas Field Guide would die down, but it did not, and so the decision to discontinue had to be made. Many of the activists groups saw their role against the publication as the major factor in its downfall.
Abercrombie & Fitch analysts received the decision with praise. Supposedly, the Quarterly was discontinued because it took up time and money that should have been allocated to more important company issues: "It was more trouble than it was worth." Store sales had been declining, with a major fall in November 2003 of 13%. As a result, the analysts/investors were being hit really hard financially. It was expected that without the weight of the Quarterly, A&F could focus more on producing better results for upcoming fiscal quarters. Analyst Robert Buchanan from A.G. Edwards & Sons wrote to investors that A&F Quarterly was unimportant in his view, and, that by recognizing this, A&F should be able to bring business back up by focusing on its clothing. Jeffrey Klinefelter of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray echoed this sentiment, hoping that the US$33 used towards the publication and marketing would help launch a successful Spring Break 2004.
The decision did not change the contempt with which some community-focused groups viewed Abercrombie & Fitch. The big question on every critic's mind was addressed by the Focus on the Family: "[Abercrombie & Fitch] will stop producing pornographic catalogues, but what will replace them?" Phil Burress, president of Citizens for Community Values, commented that "they [Abercrombie & Fitch] have a track record of sexual exploitation and there are many different ways to continue that campaign." Burres had previously posted an advertisement in The Wall Street Journal to question if A&F's investors really knew what they were investing in. Alissa Quart penned the book Branded: The Buying and Selling of Teenagers and had negative view towards the defunct publication: "It became more of an emblem than anything else. It served as an icon for the hypocrisy of America's attitude toward youth, using it as a sign of innocence while at the same time peddling a semi pornographic catalogue at them."


== Absence (2004–2007) ==
Out-of-print copies of the Quarterly have become highly sought after as collectibles. eBay is the target destination for purchasing the rare periodicals; on the site, a single copy received a bid of US$122.50 after just four hours and thirty minutes on auction.
In 2004, the defunct publication was replaced with A&F Magazine/A&F: Rising Stars, a tame collection of photos and essays about rising young celebrities. It featured Justin Bruening, Poppy Montgomery, Olivia Wilde (all from Back-to-School 2004) and Jeremy Bloom (Christmas 2004). This magazine was far less popular than the Quarterly and was soon discontinued, and for a time the company published a seasonal catalog.


== A "Return to Paradise" (2008 release) ==


=== Background and criticism ===
In 2008, Abercrombie & Fitch announced that it would relaunch A&F Quarterly exclusively for the European market, mainly the United Kingdom, where A&F hoped consumers would be more open-minded than Americans. The company planned a release in March or April 2008 in the A&F London flagship store – just over a year after the opening of the first international A&F flagship at 7 Burlington Gardens in Savile Row London, England.
Tom Lennox, vice president of corporate communications for Abercrombie & Fitch, stated, "We have chosen to bring the A&F Quarterly to the UK because our London flagship has been a phenomenal success and we were looking for something which we felt would appeal to the British open-minded approach to culture and creativity." The new European version was to be "more mature" than the previous editions in the United States, where, Lennox says, it will no longer be sold because it "has run its course" in America. Lennox said it would be more of a "sophisticated, intellectual approach" providing a "global perspective, which is what the 20-year-old is all about." Lastly, he commented that the Quarterly will be fun and may be found "controversial to some". Saying that the revamped Quarterly will stick to a "similar theme", a company representative also commented that "it will be unique and will definitely grab people's attention." It was announced that the original creative team behind the American A&F Quarterly (including Shahid and Weber) would reunite for the publication's revival in London. Featured topics would include travel, dining, and trendy neighborhoods, with some articles written by Tyler Brule (founder of the fashion, art, and travel magazine Wallpaper).
Recalling the controversial years of the Quarterly, Claude Knight, director of the charity Kidscape, stated that "unless the 2008 version takes the fate of its predecessor into account, we will not hesitate to raise grave concerns [about] a racy magazine aimed at teenagers and featuring sexually explicit content." The deputy executive of 4Children warned that careless promotion of sexual images and alcohol drinking could leave great consequences, especially in the UK, where there is "a high drinking culture and there are links between the use of alcohol and sex that is later regretted."
A UK£100 price and a massive customer turnout was expected at the flagship store over the returning publication. Market analysis revealed that the relaunch of the Quarterly in Europe came at an opportune time for Abercrombie & Fitch because tolerance for less-regulated publications is higher there, and the demand for the A&F brand is high and on the rise. This was the reason for why A&F began international expansion in the UK first.


=== The issue ===
A&F Quarterly hit shelves in the London A&F flagship on April 5, 2008 (a month later than was anticipated). The limited edition issue of 500 (2000 in total print run) copies was entitled Return to Paradise and was labeled with a price of UK£100 (US$159.00). The company set strict measures to regulate to whom the issue was sold. Demand for the edition, a worldwide exclusive, was high throughout the season. During the season, a copy was sold on eBay for £249.99 (about US$493.88).
The issue is a hardcover and is "lavishly bound" similarly to RUEHL books also by Bruce Weber. The photography carries out an overall theme of "Paradise", with models photographed with and around exotic flora. An allusion is made toward Adam and Eve in the way that two nude models behold a bitten apple. Many of the images used in the Spring 2008 season the Quarterly were also displayed in stores. Vogue UK called Weber's photography "hyper-sexy".


== 2010 comeback ==
The A&F Quarterly was resurrected as a promotional element for the Back-to-School 2010 marketing campaign titled "Screen Test".
Abercrombie & Fitch had remained tight-lipped over its plans to reintroduce A&F Quarterly throughout the whole process (2009–2010). The company introduced the "A&F Book" feature on its online store for Christmas 2009 as a collection of seasonal photography themed "FIERCE". The feature was updated for Spring 2010 in February. It was titled "Spring Fever" and remained up until April when it was removed. On regarding its "Back-to-School" 2010 campaign, in January 2010, on its iPhone app, A&F had only commented, "Brr...!!! February will be the next photo shoot for the Back-to-School/Christmas 2010 campaign. We've got our fingers crossed that we'll be going somewhere sunny, warm, and sandy..."
On 17 June 2010, Abercrombie & Fitch officially announced on its Facebook page that it is relaunching A&F Quarterly: "It's Back. Mom found it under the bed. Bought another one. Bro stole every copy. Bought more. ...Girlfriend... She just shook her head, and then 'borrowed it.' Bought back stock. The Quarterly. It's BACK! Pre-order your copy today...it's got all the things A&F does best...Abs, hot bodies and a whole lot more..." Within the following days, the announcement made headlines through various reputable news sources and fashion blogs.
An A&F spokesperson told Stylelist, "[A&F Quarterly will be] part of a larger marketing campaign that ties in with in-store happenings in July. [It'll be] sexy, playful, and provocative -- it's everything we love about Abercrombie & Fitch." Stylelist also became the first source to be provided a preview to the Quarterly. Soon after, Fashionista.com offered never-before-seen photography from the upcoming Quarterly.

The A&F Quarterly will be part of the "Back-to-School" 2010 marketing campaign and its theme being an A&F "Hollywood screen test": A lead story will be offered mimicking American Idol: "The staff of A&F Studios opens up to editorial to explain the steps the division takes to find new, young, hot boys. The cattle-call approach to herd young talent ends with the best of the beefcake earning a screen test that 'could be the flint to spark the trip to the star'." Returning to the publication is Bruce Weber, who remains exclusive photographer for the A&F company and shot the images in February 2010. Behind-the-scenes shots will also provide a look behind Weber's A&F coveted photo shoots. Fashionista praised Weber's work as "sultry, voyeuristic, black and white...classic Weber."
Sources consider the move to reintroduce the publication as a drastic attempt to boost sales in the American market. Revenue has been minimally declining since the late-2000s recession began, and the Quarterly is noticeably credited for A&F's continued success in the early 2000s in a "pre-social media" environment. Analysts noticed the increase in revenue from the 2008 Quarterly relaunch in London, and will pay attention to the results of the 2010 American relaunch. There is a majority of optimism towards the relaunch, since A&F sales have been improving recently and the Quarterly is expected to lure in shoppers. RBC Capital Markets analyst Howard Tubin mentioned that the catalog probably won't make a material difference on earnings, but added that any media exposure related to the catalog will be a positive for the New Albany, Ohio-based company." TheConsumerist.com, however, commented the timing is inopportune: "For any company, let alone an apparel retailer, to be starting a magazine in this economy really bucks the trends," said Columbus retail consultant Chris Boring of Boulevard Strategies. "I just don't see the market out there for a $10 magazine, especially with teenagers so into technology. I would think the money would be better spent on some new mobile app."
Harkening back to the original American version, the new Quarterly was designed not as exclusive as was the 2008 release. With that said, the issue was made available for pre-order online abercrombie.com on June 17 for US$10 at 176 pages. Due to suggestive content, the publication was may only available for pick-up instore with identification. The plastic wrapping contained a warning notice in three languages (English, Italian, and Japanese) while the back cover read the pricing in six different currencies (USD $10, JPY ¥1600, EUR €12, CAD $14, GBP £10, DKK 100).

=== A&G Price ===
A&G Price Limited is an engineering firm and locomotive manufacturer in Thames, New Zealand, founded in 1868.


== History ==
A&G Price was established in 1868 in Princes Street, Onehunga by Alfred Price and George Price, two brothers from Stroud, Gloucestershire. They built almost 100 flax-milling machines in their first year. The brothers also built machinery for gold miners. They moved to the Coromandel Gold Rushes in 1871 setting up premises in Beach Road, Thames and closing the Onehunga works in 1873 after building 10 coaches and 12 trucks there for the Public Works Department. The firm's ownership was transferred to a limited liability company in 1907.


=== Ownership ===

A&G Price Limited remained under family management until November 1949 when it was bought by Wellington engineers, William Cable & Company. The two companies then exchanged board members but kept their separate identities. Cable bought Downer & Co in 1954 and in 1964 William Cable Holdings was renamed Cable, Price, Downer Limited.
In 1974 the staff of A&G Price alone was in excess of 520 people. Its head office was in Fanshawe Street, Auckland. Beach Road Thames was described as a branch. In 1988 corporate raider Brierley Investments obtained control of the group parent, Cable Price Downer, and broke the group back into its three separate businesses. A&G Price, Beach Road, Thames, was until liquidation part of the Tiri Group, based in Mount Wellington and controlled from Nelson by Tom Sturgess.
In July 2017, A&G Price was placed in administration with the loss of 100 jobs. The business was bought from the administrator by Christopher Reeve in April 2018. Reeve had been unable to sell the land and buildings. The business now operates with a reduced workforce under Reeve's ownership.


== Products ==
A&G Price produced water turbines under the Pelton patent. Lester Allan Pelton invented and a highly efficient turbine patenting it in 1880. Initially, Pelton manufactured and sold the turbines to gold mine operators in the California goldfields, and later licensed the manufacturing to companies across the world. A small A&G Price turbine is on display at the Goldmine Experience in Thames, New Zealand.
Abner Doble helped A&G Price develop a steam engine for buses at the Thames workshops. The first engine was trialled by the Auckland Transport Board in the early 1930s. A second bus was made in 1932 for White and Sons for the Auckland Thames route.
In 2004 a precision-formed yacht keel division was set up to make the Maximus canting keel.


== A&G Price and railways ==
A&G Price was the largest private New Zealand railway locomotive manufacturer, both in terms of output and in terms of supply of rolling stock to the New Zealand Government Railways (NZGR or NZR) and other firms, mainly Bush tramways used for logging timber.
Price manufactured 22 carriages and wagons in the early 1870s, and manufactured two locomotives in the 1880s for private industry, the first being a 0-4-0ST Saddle Tank type locomotive. The Thames Branch railway line opened in 1898, and Price won a tender to make locomotives for NZR in 1903 and 1906. Later in the 1950s and 1960s they manufactured a number of diesel shunting locomotives for the NZR, the TR class, and some for private users.
In the 1920s several petrol tanks were built for NZR and in 1964 for Mobil. 400 LC class wagons were built in 1960.
In 1990 A&G Price regauged 24 of the 31 Silver Star carriages to metre gauge (1000 mm) for running in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand as the Eastern & Oriental Express. Six carriages from this train were stored at Price's Thames workshop in case any extra carriage conversions were required, with the remaining carriages shipped to South East Asia but not refurbished. These carriages were later sold by the Eastern & Oriental Express to private owners in New Zealand.

== Rivalries ==
A&M Consolidated has two main rivals: College Station High School and Bryan High School. The rivalry with College Station High is due to the two schools being the only two public high schools that sponsor UIL athletics teams in the city of College Station (College View High does not offer UIL athletics).  Bryan High has long been a rival of A&M Consolidated, as the two were, for many years, the only two high schools in the Twin Cities: Bryan and College Station. The rivalry between them is called the "Crosstown Showdown".

=== A&M Octone Records ===
A&M Octone Records was an American record label owned as a joint venture between James Diener and Universal Music Group. A full-service artist development label, it was founded in 2007 as a merger between Octone and Interscope Geffen A&M's defunct A&M Records label. For its six years of existence, A&M Octone operated music publishing, merchandising, and touring entities, in addition to specializing in recorded music.
In September 2013, Octone initiated its buy/sell rights in the joint venture, resulting in Interscope Geffen A&M purchasing Octone's 50% interest in A&M Octone, with Interscope absorbing and restructuring its artist roster in 2014.


== Overview ==


=== History ===
Launched in 2000, Octone Records was founded by CEO/President James Diener and distributed through Bertelsmann Music Group (known as Sony BMG from 2004 to 2008, now Sony Music). After successful signing, release, marketing and promotion on Octone, artists were given the option of upstreaming to RCA Music Group, via a joint-venture between the two companies. Upon launch, Diener and Octone Records were also well known in the music industry for their entrepreneurial private-equity financing model.
In February 2007, Interscope-Geffen-A&M partnered with Octone Records to relaunch the A&M label, headed by James Diener and called A&M/Octone Records with worldwide distribution handled by parent Universal Music Group. The existing Octone roster was transferred to the A&M/Octone label and all new artist signings were made under the A&M/Octone joint venture.
The legal name of the A&M/Octone label was "OctoScope Music, LLC" (d.b.a. A&M/Octone Records), the name derives from the merger of the labels Octone and Interscope. OctoScope Music, LLC was the copyright holder on all A&M/Octone releases. A&M/Octone Records operated from 2007 until 2014.

=== A&M Records ===
A&M Records is an American record label owned by Universal Music Group and functions as a branch of  Interscope-Geffen-A&M. Established in 1962 by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss, the label initially operated independently. It rapidly gained recognition in the music industry, becoming a major-independent label until its acquisition by PolyGram in 1989.  After this acquisition, A&M continued to operate as a self-managed frontline label within the PolyGram framework.
In 1998, PolyGram was acquired by Seagram and subsequently integrated into its Universal Music Group. In January 1999, A&M's operations were merged with Interscope Records and Geffen Records, leading to the creation of Interscope-Geffen-A&M, which is now part of the Interscope Capitol Labels Group as of 2024. Subsequently, A&M became a brand under the larger label group, no longer operating autonomously. In 2007, the A&M brand and trademark were combined with Octone Records to create A&M Octone Records, which remained operational until 2014, when it was absorbed into Interscope. Currently, select releases from A&M's catalog are managed by Verve Records, Universal Music Enterprises, and Interscope, while much of Alpert's back catalog has been issued under his label, Herb Alpert Presents.
Despite A&M's hibernation in 2014, its name and logo have remained visible on recent works by artist Sting; his latest release 2021's The Bridge featured the A&M branding. In 2024, A&M was reestablished as a brand under Interscope, with Benny Blanco taking on the role of general manager.


== History ==


=== Founding ===
A&M Records was formed in late 1962 by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss. Their first choice for a name was Carnival Records, under which they released two singles before discovering that another label had already taken the Carnival name. The company was subsequently renamed A&M, after Alpert's and Moss's initials. From 1966 to 1999, the company's headquarters and recording studios were on the grounds of the historic Charlie Chaplin Studios at 1416 North La Brea Avenue, near Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, A&M had such acts as Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass, Baja Marimba Band, Burt Bacharach, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Sérgio Mendes & Brasil ’66,  The Marauders, the Sandpipers, Boyce & Hart, We Five, the Carpenters, Chris Montez, Elkie Brooks, Lee Michaels, Captain and Tennille, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Quincy Jones, Lucille Starr, Stealers Wheel, Hoyt Axton, Gallagher and Lyle, Barry DeVorzon, Perry Botkin, Jr., Marc Benno, Liza Minnelli, Rita Coolidge, Gino Vannelli, Wes Montgomery, Jan Davis, Gerry McGee, Paul Desmond, Bobby Tench, Hummingbird, Toni Basil, and Paul Williams. Folk artists Joan Baez, Phil Ochs and Gene Clark also recorded for the label during the 1970s. Billy Preston joined the label in 1971, followed by Andre Popp and Herb Ohta in 1973.
In the late 1960s, through direct signing and licensing agreements, A&M added several British artists to its roster, including Cat Stevens, Joe Cocker, Procol Harum, Humble Pie, Fairport Convention, Free, the Move, Strawbs and Spooky Tooth. In the 1970s, under its manufacturing and distribution agreement with Ode Records, A&M released albums by Carole King and the comedy duo Cheech & Chong. Other notable acts of the time included Nazareth, Y&T, the Tubes, Styx, Supertramp, Joan Armatrading, Bell and James, Chris de Burgh (who went on to greater mainstream success in the 1980s), Rick Wakeman, the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Chuck Mangione, Squeeze, and Peter Frampton. On March 10, 1977, A&M "signed" the Sex Pistols outside Buckingham Palace in a mock signing ceremony after the band had been dropped by EMI, although the real signing had actually occurred the prior day; however, A&M dropped the band within a week. 
A&M sustained its success during the 1980s with a roster of noted acts that included Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark; Henry Badowski; Janet Jackson; the Police; Sting; the Brothers Johnson; Falco; Atlantic Starr; the Go-Go's; Bryan Adams; Suzanne Vega; Righeira; Brenda Russell; Jeffrey Osborne; Oingo Boingo; the Human League; Ozark Mountain Daredevils; Sharon, Lois & Bram; Annabel Lamb;  Jim Diamond; Vital Signs; Joe Jackson; Charlie Peacock; Vesta Williams; and Scottish rock band Gun. They also, through a deal with Christian music label Myrrh, distributed back catalog recordings of Amy Grant as well as her new recordings, starting with 1985's Unguarded, to the mainstream marketplace, a vital component in her subsequent breakthrough as a mainstream artist.
Within a decade of its inception, A&M became the world's largest independent record company. A&M releases were initially issued in the United Kingdom by EMI's Stateside Records label, and then under its own name by Pye Records, who released the first Herb Alpert records on the Pye International label before issuing the records on  the A&M label until 1967. From 1969, A&M set up its own UK base appointing John Deacon (not to be confused with Queen's bass guitarist of the same name) as general manager, a post he held until 1979. Several A&R men were recruited including Larry Yaskiel, Derek Green and Mike Noble and major UK acts such as the Police, Supertramp, Rick Wakeman, Squeeze, Gallagher & Lyle, Elkie Brooks, the Strawbs and Peter Frampton as well as many others were all signed to the UK label. A&M releases were also issued in Australia through Festival Records until 1989. A&M Records Ltd. was established in 1970, with distribution handled by other labels with a presence in Europe. A&M Records of Canada Ltd. was also formed in 1970, and A&M Records of Europe in 1977. In 1979, A&M entered a distribution agreement with RCA Records in the US, and with CBS Records in many other countries.
Over the years, A&M added specialty imprints: Almo International for middle of the road; Omen Records (1964–1966) for soul; Horizon Records for jazz (1974–1978); AyM Discos for Latin-American; Vendetta Records for dance music (1988–1990); and  Tuff Break Records for hip-hop music (1993–1995).


=== Acquisition by PolyGram ===
A&M was bought by PolyGram for $500 million in 1989. Alpert and Moss continued to manage the label until 1993. In 1998, Alpert and Moss sued PolyGram for breach of the integrity clause, eventually settling for an additional $200 million payment.
In 1991, A&M launched Perspective Records as a joint venture with producing team Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.  Jam and Lewis stepped down as CEOs of the imprint in 1997, but they remained on as consultants. In 1999, the label was absorbed into A&M. In the mid-1990s, A&M began distributing its PolyGram sister label Polydor Records in the US.
During the 1990s, the company continued to release albums by Paw, Soundgarden, Extreme, Amy Grant, John Hiatt, Sting, Blues Traveler, Barry White, and Aaron Neville, as well as material from new artists Sheryl Crow, Monster Magnet, Therapy?, CeCe Peniston, Intelligent Hoodlum, Dred Scott, Ridel High and Gin Blossoms.  The company released the soundtracks Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, The Three Musketeers, Sabrina, The Living Sea, Demolition Man, and Lethal Weapon 3.


=== Universal Music Group merging and Interscope Geffen A&M ===
In 1998, PolyGram was bought by Seagram and merged into Universal Music Group, which was formed in 1996 as the successor to MCA Music Entertainment Group, of which MCA Records had been the flagship. A&M was subsequently merged into Universal Music Group's then newly formed Interscope Geffen A&M label group. Its Canadian division was absorbed into Universal Music Canada at that time, which included Jann Arden alongside other artists from Canada.
The A&M lot on La Brea Avenue was shut down in January 1999. During the farewell celebration, the company's staff placed a black band over the A&M sign above the main entrance, indicating the death of the company. The former A&M studios and executive offices became the home of the Jim Henson Company, which operates Henson Recording Studios. Most of the company's workforce, some of whom had been with the company for a decade or more, were let go while many of its artists were dropped. The label's more prominent acts such as Sting, Sheryl Crow, Bryan Adams and Chris Cornell, however, remained on its roster.

In response to the down-sourcing, Al Cafaro stated, This isn't about Universal or Seagram. The record business is changing fundamentally. Don't think that there are calm seas on the other side of this threshold. If the quake that devoured A&M and Geffen is a 6.0 on the Richter scale, there is a 7.0 coming in this industry. It's a Wall Street world now. Get ready.
A&M catalog albums that did not fit the current pop music format (which also includes rock, rap and R&B) of their new parent division were transferred to other Universal divisions for management - for example, Verve Records now manages A&M's jazz catalog, not including Herb Alpert's recorded output which Alpert acquired in the settlement with Universal Music (however, Verve does manage the Horizon Records catalog).
Despite the shutdown, the A&M name continued to be used on albums from artists such as Snow Patrol, the Black Eyed Peas and Keyshia Cole—a result of Alpert and Moss's 1998 lawsuit—until February 2007, when Interscope Geffen A&M partnered with Octone Records to relaunch the A&M label fully. Now headed by James Diener and called A&M/Octone Records with worldwide distribution handled by parent Universal Music Group, the existing Octone roster was transferred to the A&M/Octone label and all newer artist signings were made under the A&M/Octone joint venture. Acts that were already signed to the label before the merger with Octone, however, would remain on the main A&M label.
After six successful years of operation, in September 2013, Octone initiated its buy/sell rights in the joint venture, resulting in Interscope-Geffen-A&M (now Interscope Capitol Labels Group, as of 2024) purchasing Octone Records' 50% interest in A&M/Octone, absorbing and restructuring the artist roster into Interscope operations in 2014 as announced.


=== Continued releases by Sting and reboot ===
Since the label's second dissolution, label artist Sting continued to license the A&M name and logo for his future album releases, starting with 2013's The Last Ship and continuing lately with 2021's The Bridge.
The label was once again relaunched in November 2024 by Interscope as a subsidiary (currently under legal name: A&M Records, LLC) and has a new roster, including the Rolling Stones, Reneé Rapp, Apink, Astrid S, Victoria De Angelis, Epex, Tame Impala (from Modular Recordings), Dean, Benny Blanco (from his own labels, Mad Love Records and Friends Keep Secrets) and OneRepublic (from Mosley Music Group). A&M operates under the UMG umbrella through its subsidiary Interscope Capitol Labels Group.

=== A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc. ===
A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (9th. Cir., 2001) was a landmark intellectual property case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a district court ruling that the defendant, peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, could be held liable for contributory infringement and vicarious infringement of copyright. This was the first major case to address the application of copyright laws to peer-to-peer file sharing.
While A&M Records served as the lead plaintiff, Napster was sued by 18 different record companies, all of which were members of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Additionally, songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were included on the Circuit Court appeal, representing the interests of "all others similarly situated."


== Background ==
Napster was founded in 1999 by 18 year-old Shawn Fanning. Napster provided a platform for users to download compressed digital music files, specifically MP3s, from other users' music libraries. Unlike many peer-to-peer services, however, Napster included a central server that indexed connected users and files available on their machines, creating a searchable list of music available across Napster's network. Napster's ease of use compared to other peer-to-peer services quickly made it a popular service for music enthusiasts to find and download digital song files for free.
The legacy record industry immediately took action against what it believed to be unauthorized copying of its copyrighted musical works within the Napster service. The first suit was filed at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.


== District Court opinion ==
The record companies alleged both contributory and vicarious copyright infringement by Napster, and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in order to stop the exchange of the plaintiffs' songs on the service immediately.
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted the preliminary injunction, on the grounds that the plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success. She issued an injunction which immediately prohibited Napster: "from engaging in, or facilitating others in copying, downloading, uploading, transmitting, or distributing plaintiffs' copyrighted musical compositions and sound recordings, protected by either federal or state law, without express permission of the rights owner."
Napster appealed this ruling to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.


== Circuit Court opinion ==
On appeal, the Ninth Circuit ordered a stay of the District Court's injunction, pending resolution. This allowed Napster to continue its operations until the rendering of a judgment at the end of the hearings. On the matter of direct copyright infringement, the Circuit Court agreed with the District Court's determination that Napster users were likely engaging in direct infringement of the plaintiffs' copyrights.


=== Fair use ===
The Circuit Court dedicated much more of its opinion to Napster's attempted application of the fair use defense. The Circuit Court agreed with the District Court's "general analysis of Napster system uses" as well as with its analysis of the three types of fair use alleged by Napster, which were "sampling, where users make temporary copies of a work before purchasing; space shifting, where users access a sound recording through the Napster system that they already own in audio CD format; and permissive distribution of recordings by both new and established artists."
The court first considered these four factors required for the fair use defense:

Downloading an MP3 is not transformative, and even though Napster did not directly benefit financially from users' downloads (it did not charge for the service), its "repeated and exploitative copying of copyrighted works, even if the copies are not offered for sale" could be considered a commercial use that requires authorization from copyright holders.
Creative works, such as the songs in question, are "closer to the core of intended copyright protection", thus favoring the plaintiffs.
In some cases, wholesale copying of a work may be allowable, with time shifting as an example.
Widespread wholesale transfer of plaintiffs' music negatively affected the market for CD sales and jeopardized the record industry's future in digital markets.
Thus, the Circuit Court rejected Napster's argument that file sharing by its users qualified for the fair use defense. Napster's claims that it enabled legal sampling, space shifting, and permissive distribution (some artists had consented to the presence of their songs on the Napster service) were also rejected by the court. Furthermore, the court found that Napster could control the infringing behavior of the service's users, and therefore had a duty to do so. Therefore, Napster did not have a valid fair use defense.


=== Contributory infringement ===
The district court had ruled that the "law does not require knowledge of 'specific acts of infringement'," and rejected Napster's assertion that, because it could not distinguish between infringing and non-infringing files, it did not have knowledge of copyright infringement by its users. The Ninth Circuit upheld this conclusion, holding that Napster had "knowledge, both actual and constructive, of direct infringement."
The Ninth Circuit also held that Napster was not protected under Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., in which the Supreme Court ruled that media copying technologies were acceptable if they were unlikely to cause widespread copyright infringement beyond the original user. Because of Napster's "actual, specific knowledge of direct infringement,"  and the unlikelihood of non-infringing uses of Napster, "[W]e are compelled to make a clear distinction between the architecture of the Napster system and Napster's conduct in relation to the operational capacity of the system." Thus, the Circuit Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs' contributory infringement claim against Napster.


=== Vicarious infringement ===
Addressing the vicarious infringement claim, the Ninth Circuit determined that Napster stood to benefit financially from the infringing activity, due to the network effects of potentially selling advertising space for a large population of users, and that Napster's ability to patrol and enforce infringing usage was limited by the design of the system itself. The system was not designed to read the contents of MP3s or check for copyright ownership or permissions. Because of Napster's failure to police within its means combined with the financial interest factor, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's finding of vicarious infringement.


=== Other defenses ===
In its defense against the injunction, Napster also cited the Audio Home Recording Act (17 U.S.C. §§ 1001). and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's safe harbor clause (17 U.S.C. § 512), claiming that Napster users only made allowable copies of files for their personal use, with no interest in wider distribution of unauthorized copies. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the District Court's finding that downloading MP3 files is not covered by the Audio Home Recording Act because online file sharing could spread unauthorized copies much more quickly than older forms of analog tape trading.
Napster also argued that the record companies waived their rights to copyright protection because they "hastened" the spread of MP3s on the Internet and had their own plans to get into the digital market. The Ninth Circuit rejected Napster's claim that, by creating and providing digital files via the Internet, the plaintiffs had granted Napster an "implied license" to enable the copying of music files. Finally, Napster argued that the plaintiffs were misusing copyright law to control online distribution, which Napster considered beyond the scope of the limited ownership rights provided by copyright. The court rejected this argument as well, finding that MP3s were the same works as those that appeared on CDs, just in a different format, thus the plaintiffs had the ownership right to control the distribution of digital music.


=== Scope of the injunction ===
Napster contended that the original District Court injunction shutting down its operations violated the company's First Amendment rights because it was overbroad and restricted other user activities beyond copyright infringement. While the Ninth Circuit rejected this argument due to Napster's unsuccessful fair use defense for copyright infringement, it did order a stay of the original injunction and agreed that it was overbroad because "it places on Napster the entire burden of ensuring that no 'copying, downloading, uploading, transmitting, or distributing' of plaintiffs' works occur on the system."
Recognizing that Napster's system simply indexed files with imperfect file names and did not automatically verify copyright ownership, the Circuit Court found that it was the plaintiffs' burden to notify Napster of any infringing files on the system, which Napster would then remove. But the court also again noted that Napster must police the system within its means: "In crafting the injunction on remand, the district court should recognize that Napster's system does not currently appear to allow Napster access to users' MP3 files."


=== Outcome ===
To determine whether Napster should be permitted to continue functioning, the Circuit Court remanded the case back to the District Court for another trial in which Napster would be required to show that it could keep track of user activities on its network and restrict access to infringing material by its users. Napster was unable to comply and thus had to close down its service in July 2001. The following year, Napster filed for bankruptcy and sold its assets to a third party. The owners of the service settled with songwriters and music publishers, agreeing to pay $26 million.


== Criticism and impact ==
Among a number of amicus briefs filed on behalf of both sides of the dispute, one particularly critical brief filed by a consortium of eighteen American copyright law professors argued that the district court misread the Sony precedent and took too narrow a view of fair use. The professors argued that the overbroad nature of the injunction threatened the development and deployment of future peer-to-peer file-sharing networks on the Internet because it insisted on a restructuring that defeated peer-to-peer technology itself. They also argued that the finding of contributory liability was erroneous because of Napster's significant non-infringing uses and because not all unauthorized uses within the system were copyright infringement. They concluded: "If Plaintiffs want copyright law extended to allow the suppression of new technologies, they must make their case to Congress."
A number of file-sharing networks surfaced in Napster's wake, including Morpheus, Grokster, and KaZaA, many of which faced their own legal challenges over infringing behavior by their users. In 2005, MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. was heard by the Supreme Court and is considered by many to be the sequel to the Napster case, addressing another technology that "outpaced the law." In the following years, BitTorrent, another P2P technology, became the target of copyright scrutiny. Popular torrent trackers like the Pirate Bay faced long legal battles, but their opponents have had little success in shutting down these services permanently.

=== A&N International Media ===
A&N International Media, formerly Northcliffe International, was the Central and Eastern European multimedia enterprise arm of Daily Mail and General Trust. It had newspapers throughout Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, with their biggest market in Hungary. They also had website interests in Croatia, owning four shopping, home and car websites as well as in Slovakia and Hungary.
The international arm began in 1989, when the Northcliffe Newspaper Group acquired Kisalföld, the largest regional newspaper in Hungary, serving the north-western county of Győr-Sopron. The group later acquired Délmagyarország, the largest daily title in the south-east of the country, and the English-language weekly newspaper, The Budapest Sun. Northcliffe also invested significantly in new headquarters and printing plants in both Győr and Szeged.
DMGT sold its Central and Eastern European properties in 2012 and 2013:

Használtautó was sold to Schibsted
jobs websites in the Slovakian, Czech and Croatian markets, and minority stakes of job websites operating in the Serbian and Bosnian markets were sold to Alma Media
the Hungarian newspapers were sold to Elliott Management Corporation


== Hungary ==
In Hungary Kisalföld, a morning newspaper based in Győr, had the highest circulation of any regional title in the country, selling an average 78,000 copies Monday to Saturday. It also publishes a daily edition for the town of Sopron. Northcliffe International also published Délmagyarország, Hungary's oldest regional daily newspaper and the largest selling title in the south-eastern region. In addition it published Délvilág for Csongrád county. Other publications included classified titles Magyar Bazár and Irányár. Websites included Használtautó, a car finder website (similar to that of DMGT's Loot newspaper and website in Britain), Ingatlanbazár, a house finder website (similar to that of DMGT's Primelocation website in the UK) and Workania, a work finder website (yet again similar to Jobsite in the UK owned by DMGT).
Other newspapers owned by the group included the paid-for:

=== A&O Hotels and Hostels ===
a&o Hotels and Hostels GmbH is a chain of hostels, headquartered in Berlin, that targets young travelers and backpackers, offering cheap group rooms and hotel rooms for two. The hostels are generally centrally located, mostly close to train stations. A&O has 39 subsidiaries in nine countries, making it the biggest privately owned hostel-chain in Europe. In 2023 it recorded about 6.1 million overnight stays and realised sales of €217 million.


== History ==

Founder Oliver Winter had the idea of opening a hostel after several trips through Europe in the late 1990s. There were few hostels in urban areas in Germany at that time; hostels in Germany were mostly situated in suburban or rural areas and were run by the German Youth Hostel Association; this was a problem for foreign travellers, because only members of the organisation could stay there.
In the year 2000 Winter and his landlord Michael Kluge opened the first a&o Hostel in Berlin Friedrichshain with 164 beds. After a year they doubled the number of beds, and in the years 2002 and 2004, they opened new hostels in Berlin. In 2005 the company opened its first houses outside Berlin, in Prague, Hamburg and Munich. From then on the company established various subsidiaries every year, mostly in Germany, but also in bordering countries.
In 2009, the company made headlines by winning a nearly 5-year-long Lawsuit against the DJH, the German Youth Hostel Association. In 2005, the DJH accused a&o of illegally using the word "Jugendherberge", the German term for youth hostel, which DJH had registered word as a brand in 1998. a&o objected and wanted the brand to be deleted, claiming that the word "Jugendherberge" is too common to be protected. Finally, in 2009 the Federal Patent Court of Germany decided that "Jugendherberge" should be deleted from the brand register.
In 2017, the Investment company TPG Capital purchased the majority of the company shares. Since a&o has been acquired by TPG, they massively reinforced their expansion plans. The company published a list of 25 cities in Europe, where new hostels shall be opened in the near future. Besides nine locations in A&O's core markets Germany and Austria, the list also contains cities in Ireland, Scotland, England, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

=== A&P ===
The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, better known as A&P, was an American chain of grocery stores that operated from 1859 to 2015. From 1915 through 1975, A&P was the largest grocery retailer in the United States (and, until 1965, the largest U.S. retailer of any kind).
A&P was considered an American icon that, according to The Wall Street Journal, "was as well known as McDonald's or Google is today". At its peak in the 1940s, A&P captured 10% of total US grocery spending. Known for innovation, A&P improved consumers' nutritional habits by making available a vast assortment of food products at much lower costs. Until 1982, A&P also was a large food manufacturer.
A&P was founded in 1859 as "Gilman & Company" by George Gilman, who opened a small chain of retail tea and coffee stores in New York City, and then expanded to a national mail order business. The firm grew to 70 stores by 1878; by 1900, it operated almost 200 stores. A&P grew dramatically by introducing the economy store concept in 1912, growing to 1,600 stores by 1915. After World War I, it added stores that offered meat and produce, while expanding manufacturing.
In 1930, A&P, by then the world's largest retailer, reached $2.9 billion in sales ($54.6 billion today) with 15,000 stores. In 1936, it adopted the self-serve supermarket concept and opened 4,000 larger stores (while phasing out many of its smaller units) by 1950. After two bankruptcies, A&P finally closed the last of its doors in 2015.


== History ==


=== 1859–1878: Gilman era ===
The forerunner of A&P was founded in the 1850s as Gilman & Company by George Gilman (1826–1901) to continue his father's leather tanning business; in 1858 the firm's address was 98 Gold Street in Manhattan. Gilman's father died in 1859, leaving the son wealthy. That year, Gilman & Company entered the tea and coffee business from that storefront. One source speculates that Gilman decided to enter a more respectable business in light of his wealth. In May 1861, Gilman turned over the tanning business to his brother Winthrop; George moved his tea business to 129 Front Street. Initially, Gilman & Company was a wholesaler. In early 1863 the firm became a retailer, Great American Tea Company. Quickly, it opened five stores, moving its office and warehouse to 51 Vesey Street.
Gilman proved to be a master at promotion; the business quickly expanded by advertising low prices. The firm was able to offer low prices by acting as both the wholesaler and retailer. Gilman also built a nationwide mail order business. By 1866, the firm was valued at more than $1 million (~$16.3 million in 2023). In 1869, the transcontinental railroad was completed; Gilman created a parallel company, the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, to promote the then-new concept of prepackaged tea under the Thea-Nector name. The tea company, which some sources say was co-founded by George Huntington Hartford, continued to use the Great American name for mail-order purposes. In 1871, A&P introduced another concept when it offered premiums, such as lithographs, china, and glassware with the purchase of coffee and/or tea at its stores. These premiums are now collectibles.


=== 1878–1951: Hartford era ===


==== Evolution of the grocery store ====

Hartford joined Gilman & Company as a clerk perhaps in the late 1850s; Hartford later was promoted to bookkeeper, then cashier, in 1866. By 1871 Hartford was in a position of authority and was responsible for expanding A&P to Chicago after its great fire. A&P's first store outside New York City was opened just days after the disaster. The firm rapidly expanded; in 1875 A&P had stores in 16 cities. In 1878, Gilman left the active management of the firm to Hartford. By then, the firm operated 70 lavishly-equipped stores and a mail order business with combined annual sales of $1 million.

To raise revenue, Congress raised tariffs on tea and coffee. Profits on these products declined; around 1880 A&P started to sell sugar in its stores. The company continued aggressive growth and by 1884 operated stores as far west as Kansas City and as far south as Atlanta. The company also operated wagon routes to serve rural customers. About this time, two of Hartford's sons, George (1864–1957) and John (1872–1951), joined the firm. A&P lore holds that George convinced his father to expand the product line to include A&P-branded baking powder. Over the next decade, the company added other A&P-branded products, such as condensed milk, spices, and butter. As it expanded its offerings, the tea company was gradually creating the first grocery chain. By 1900, the firm had sales of $5 million (~$151 million in 2023) from 198 stores as well as its mail order and wagon route operations. However, other grocery chains were expanding more rapidly and blanketing their respective areas while the tea company's stores were spread over a much larger area. A&P quickly found itself at a disadvantage.

In 1901, George Gilman died without a will, starting a legal battle among his numerous heirs. The senior Hartford stepped into the battle by asserting that, in 1878, Gilman gave him half of the company in an unwritten partnership agreement. Evidence provided to the court established that Hartford received half of A&P's profits starting in 1878 and that the company's leases were in his name. The heirs realized that without Hartford, the firm would quickly become unprofitable. Therefore, in 1902 they agreed to a settlement where A&P was to be incorporated, with $2.1 million (~$59.9 million in 2023) in assets.
Under this agreement, the Gilman heirs received $1.25 million in preferred shares at 6% interest, while Hartford received $700,000 in common stock and the remainder of the preferred shares. This gave Hartford control of the voting stock. Over several years, Hartford was able to repurchase the preferred shares from the Gilman heirs.  A&P opened an average of one store every three weeks. A nine-story headquarters and warehouse was built in Jersey City; it later expanded to include a manufacturing plant and bakery.
By 1908, George Hartford Sr. divided management responsibilities among his sons, with George Jr. controlling finance with John directing sales and operations. The sons ran A&P for over 40 years. The younger Hartford moved aggressively to promote the A&P brand, dramatically increasing the product line. To make space for the new items, A&P replaced in-store premiums with Plaid Stamps, which sought to mimic S&H Green Stamps, a popular rewards program. By 1912, the corporation operated 400 stores and averaged a 22% gross margin, resulting in a 2% profit. A&P's peddlers were also operating 5,000 rural routes in distinctive red-and-black wagons.


==== Development of economy stores ====
Food prices were a political issue in the 1912 presidential election after a 35% increase in 10 years. To counter this trend, some chains experimented with a no-frills format. After long debate, the Hartfords agreed to John's proposal of experimenting with an economy store designed to operate at a 12% gross margin. Capitalized at only $3,000 including its initial inventory, the prototype economy store operated with only a manager, and without fancy fixtures. Within two months, weekly sales increased to $800 and the store achieved a 30% annual return on investment. A&P quickly expanded the concept; by 1915 the chain operated 1,600 stores.
A&P's tremendous growth created problems with suppliers. Cream of Wheat, the largest breakfast food manufacturer, demanded that all retailers adhere to the cereal's pricing per box. A&P purchased the product at wholesale, 11 cents per box (3 cents less), and decided that a 1-cent markup was appropriate for its economy store format. Cream of Wheat cut off supplies and A&P sued. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Hough ruled against A&P, saying that a manufacturer can establish retail prices. As a result, A&P and other large chains expanded manufacturing of private brands.
Hartford Sr. died in 1917; control of the company passed into a trust with his sons George, Edward, and John as trustees in complete control.


==== Adding stores that included grocery, meat, produce, and dairy ====
After World War I, A&P rapidly expanded; in 1925 it operated 13,961 stores. The newer combination stores included space for meats, produce, and dairy, as well as traditional grocery items. Sales reached $400 million and profit was $10 million. However, the Hartford brothers were concerned that gross margins had reached 22% to cover higher costs and that the chain veered from its low-cost discipline. In early 1926, the brothers discussed the situation with division management and launched a program to lower prices and improve cost controls. That year, sales increased 32%; A&P moved its headquarters to the new Graybar Building adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.
In 1927, A&P established a Canadian division; by 1929 it operated 200 stores in Ontario and Quebec. In 1930, the corporation's 16,000 stores reached $2.9 billion (~$42.1 billion in 2023) in sales, resulting in a 25% grocery-store share in its operating areas, and about 10% nationwide. No retail company had ever achieved these results. A&P was twice as large as the next largest retailer, Sears, and four times that of grocer Kroger. Unlike most of its competitors, A&P was in excellent position to weather the Great Depression. The Hartfords built their chain without borrowing; their low-price format resulted in even higher sales. From 1929 through 1932, A&P reported a record $110 million in after-tax profits with each Hartford child earning over $5 million yearly in dividends and equity.
A&P's success caused a backlash that threatened to destroy it. Thousands of mom-and-pop grocery stores could not match A&P's prices. While small operators had little political clout, they were supplied by thousands of wholesale distributors which had considerable political influence. Anti-chain store movements gained traction in the 1920s, but became stronger during the Depression. In 1935, Texas Congressman Wright Patman introduced legislation that would have levied a federal tax on chain stores. If adopted, this legislation likely would have ended A&P.
While this legislation did not move in Congress, in 1936 Patman sponsored the Robinson–Patman Act that outlawed charging different prices to similar customers; this law passed. Patman then reintroduced his first bill. A&P retained a lobbyist and dropped its opposition to unionizing activities of the politically powerful American Federation of Labor. George and John Hartford also took the unusual step of publishing an open letter pointing out that the legislation would increase food prices. The tide of public opinion then turned against the bill, which was defeated.


==== Converting to supermarkets ====

In 1930, the first supermarket opened in California. On the East Coast, Michael J. Cullen, a then-former A&P employee, opened his first King Kullen supermarket in Jamaica, Queens. Two years later, Big Bear opened in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and quickly equaled the sales of 100 A&Ps. In 1933, A&P's sales dropped 19%, to $820 million, because of the competition. After considerable debate, the Hartford brothers decided to open 100 supermarkets, the first of which was in Braddock, Pennsylvania. The new stores proved to be very successful; in 1938, the company operated 1,100 supermarkets. The chain continued to build supermarkets and slowly phase out smaller stores except in dense urban areas; in 1950, A&P operated 4,000 supermarkets and 500 smaller stores. Sales reached $3.2 billion with an after-tax profit of $32 million.
A&P's success attracted the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's anti-trust chief, Thurman Arnold, who was urged by Representative Wright Patman to investigate A&P. In 1942, A&P and their senior executives—including the Hartford brothers—were criminally charged for restraint of trade in Dallas federal court. In 1944, prosecutors withdrew the complaint on grounds that the Dallas federal judge thought the case was weak.
The same day the Dallas case was withdrawn, charges were filed in Danville, Illinois against the same defendants, and were assigned to Federal Judge Walter Lindley. The prosecution complained that A&P had an unfair competitive advantage because their vertical integration including manufacturing; warehousing, and retailing allowed them to charge lower prices. Prosecutors also complained that A&P refused to buy from food retailers who sold only through brokers or refused to give A&P advertising allowances. The judges contended that if unchecked, A&P would become a monopoly. A&P said their grocery-store share was only about 15%, much less than the leaders in other industries. Judge Lindley agreed with the government, fining each defendant $10,000.
In 1949, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld Lindley's decision; A&P decided not to appeal further. In September, the anti-trust division asked the court to order the spinoff of A&P's manufacturing operations and the breakup of A&P's retail operations into seven independent companies. Thousands of letters poured into the Justice Department supporting A&P; the Hartford brothers gave extensive interviews with Time magazine and appeared on the November 13, 1950, cover. Time wrote that, next to General Motors, A&P sold more goods than any other retailer in the world. John was quoted as saying, "I don't know any grocer who wants to stay small ... I don't see how any businessman can limit his growth and stay healthy." The case dragged on into the business-friendly Eisenhower administration. In late 1953, the government agreed to drop its demands to break up A&P if they shut down their produce brokerage that also supplied competitors.
In fighting the anti-trust suits, A&P also emphasized the considerable impact of their activities on the public welfare, which had been recognized as the legacy of George Hartford Sr. and his sons. The concepts pioneered and perfected by the Hartfords and their competitors enabled the public to enjoy healthier eating at lower cost. In 1950, the average American consumed 10 percent more food than in 1930, with poorer households enjoying an especially important improvement in the quality of the food they consumed. John Kenneth Galbraith supported this contention in his 1952 book, American Capitalism, by citing A&P as an example of countervailing power. To support his thesis, he discussed a 1937 A&P study of the feasibility of opening a plant to manufacture corn flakes. The mere possibility of A&P producing corn flakes forced existing corn flake manufacturers to lower their prices by 10%.


=== 1951–1974: Post-Hartford era ===

In 1951, John Hartford died in the Chrysler Building after returning from a meeting of the automaker's board of directors. George remained as A&P's chairman and treasurer, appointing the corporation's longtime secretary Ralph Burger as its new president. While Burger started with A&P in 1910 as a clerk in Glens Falls, New York, he was a staffer who lacked John Hartford's strategic marketing skills. Under Burger, A&P continued to report record sales and operated with expenses of 12.6% of sales when the industry average was 15%.
Burger was also president of the John A. Hartford Foundation started by sons John and George in 1929, assuring Burger's control of A&P when George died in 1957. George's trust was dissolved; the stock began selling on the New York Stock Exchange (under the symbol GAP) at $59 per share. For the first time, A&P elected six outside directors onto its board. In late 1961, A&P stock peaked at $70 (~$547.00 in 2023).
The seeds for A&P's 35-year fall from the country's largest grocery to bankruptcy (and later liquidation) were planted in the 1950s:

A&P was starved of capital. While A&P was publicly traded, control rested with Burger, who headed both the corporation and the Hartford Foundation. Most of A&P's profit was declared as dividends to satisfy the income needs of the trust and its heirs. A&P also remained opposed to debt financing; the only source of capital was the depreciation account. While competitors invested in larger, modern supermarkets, A&P was slow to update its retail capital plant. By 1970, A&P stores were considerably smaller and mostly older than those of its competitors.
A&P placed too much emphasis on private label products. In 1951, the Supreme Court ruled that manufacturers could not establish minimum prices unless the retailer agreed to the arrangement. This decision launched a revolution in discount retailing fueled by the rapid increase in television advertising that raised demand for national brands. Contrary to this, A&P invested substantial amounts of its scarce capital to expand manufacturing, including $25 million to construct the world's largest food plant in Horseheads, New York. Because A&P stores were smaller, its shelves were dominated by private-label products, and customers found that national brands were often out of stock.
A&P's labor costs were higher than those of most competitors. Because A&P stopped growing, a rising percentage of its workers were making higher wages due to their seniority. This was not a problem for most of A&P's competitors because they were rapidly expanding and had relatively fewer workers with high seniority. To offset higher labor costs, A&P tried to operate stores with fewer employees, resulting in long lines at checkouts and empty shelves.
Ralph Burger attempted to reverse downward tonnage figures by reintroducing trading stamps, creating A&P's Plaid Stamps. However, by late 1962, the initial sales gains evaporated and the six outside directors threatened to resign unless Burger retired. When Burger left in May 1963, the stock was trading in the $30s (~$308.00 in 2024). Burger was replaced with a succession of presidents who were unable to stem the downward spiral. In 1971, the board turned to William J. Kane, who joined A&P in 1934 as a full-time store clerk. Kane believed that A&P could be turned around by focusing on basic store operations, including cleanliness, product availability, customer service, and courtesy.
When his program stalled, Kane implemented a strategy to substantially cut prices by converting A&P to a warehouse store concept that became known as W.E.O. Warehouse Economy Outlet (or Where Economy Originates). The problem was that most A&Ps were not large enough to properly implement the program; losses quickly mounted. In early 1973, the stock dropped to $17, and Charles Bluhdorn of Gulf+Western made a tender offer at $20 per share. Kane rejected the offer, although some stockholders thought that the offer was attractive considering A&P's continuing difficulties. A&P exited California and Washington state in 1971 and 1974, respectively, making Missouri its westernmost reach. In 1974, the corporation also left its long-time headquarters in the Graybar Building, moving to Montvale, New Jersey.


=== 1975–2001: Scott/Wood era ===

In February 1975, A&P considered a plan by Booz Allen Hamilton to close 36% of its 3,468 stores. Kane agreed to resign and was replaced by Jonathan Scott, the 44-year-old president of Albertsons. Under Scott, A&P closed 1,500 stores in three years, reducing to 1,978 units. Scott hired numerous executives from outside and pushed authority down to the regional level. During his first three years, A&P built 300 supermarkets ranging from 23,000 square feet (2,100 m2) to 32,000 square feet (3,000 m2), along with its first combination grocery-drug stores with 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) under the A&P Family Mart name. The first Family Mart opened in Greenville, South Carolina, as The Family Mart in 1977.
The Family Mart chain consisted of mostly 40,000–55,000 square feet (3,700–5,100 m2) stores, and were among the first A&P stores to possess a combination of a full-service supermarket and pharmacy. Scott continued Kane's efforts to improve basic store operations (including cleanliness and customer service) instituting a large training program. Weekly per-store sales increased from $37,000 in 1974 to over $70,000 in 1976, with total sales increasing from $6.4 billion to $7.2 billion despite the closures. Manufacturing was also reorganized. While initial results were promising, by 1978, A&P profits started to slide due to economic conditions caused by high inflation.

With the share price down to $7, the John A. Hartford Foundation finally came to the conclusion that it could no longer wait for a turnaround. Erivan Haub, owner of the German Tengelmann Group, expressed interest. Born in 1930, Haub studied retailing in the U.S. after World War II and built his family's grocery business into a 2,000-store chain with annual sales of the equivalent of $2 billion. Although still having a home in Germany, his children were born in the United States.
Haub agreed to pay $7.375 per share for 42% of A&P's stock. Haub also quietly bought other shares until he owned 50.3% in February 1981. Scott did not renew his five-year contract; Haub hired James Wood to become chairman. Wood, an Englishman who was the same age as Haub, previously ran the American Grand Union supermarket chain. Many executives recruited by Scott left A&P; they were replaced by Wood's associates from Grand Union.
In Germany, Tengelmann had considerable success with Plus stores; they were smaller units featuring low price private-label products along with a limited assortment of meats and produce. A&P opened several divisions of Plus stores in the U.S. to take advantage of A&P's manufacturing plants and numerous small stores. However, the concept failed to win American customers who were attracted to other chains offering low prices on national brands.
James Wood realized that another massive store-closing program was necessary to turn around A&P. In October 1981, it announced that it would downsize to under 1,000 stores and close the Chicago division. Under the plan, A&P also closed its large manufacturing group except the four coffee warehouses. To finance this program, A&P planned to terminate its non-union pension plan, using its $200 million surplus. The plan's obligations were covered by annuities that cost only about $130 million because of the then high interest rates. A&P's non-union employees were covered by a defined contribution 401(k).
William Walsh, then a recently retired executive, filed a class action that was ultimately settled by increasing the value of the annuities. A&P still realized over $200 million and was not required to pay taxes because of tax losses carried forward from previous closing programs. The Philadelphia division also was to close, unless the unions agreed to contract concessions. When the unions refused, A&P started implementing the plan. The unions offered to purchase the stores, but realized that they did not have the capital required. As an alternative, the unions agreed to a profit-sharing arrangement if A&P formed a new subsidiary, and operated under a different name. The new banner, "Super Fresh", proved profitable. A&P realized that its name was not the asset it had been.

 A&P started to acquire stores from other chains. Starting in 1982, A&P acquired several chains that continued to be operated under their own names, rather than being converted to A&P. While A&P regained profitability in the 1980s, in 2002 it operated at a record loss because of new competition, especially from Walmart. A&P closed more stores, which included the sale of its large Canadian division. A&P also spun off Eight O'Clock Coffee, the last of its manufacturing units. In 1982, Stop & Shop exited New Jersey, not returning for almost 20 years. A&P purchased most of these stores to replace obsolete ones. In 1983, A&P bought Wisconsin-based Kohl's Food Stores (which had been part of the Kohl's department store chain) from BATUS, enabling A&P to reenter Wisconsin and Illinois. In 1984, A&P purchased Pantry Pride's Richmond, Virginia, division. The next year, A&P reinforced its profitable Canadian division by closing stores in Quebec, and acquiring Ontario's Dominion Stores. In the U.S., A&P started construction of larger 40,000-square-foot (4,000 m2) supermarkets known as A&P Future Stores.
In 1986, A&P purchased Waldbaum's (with stores in southern New York and southern New England) and The Food Emporium, the latter an upscale New York City-based chain. In 1989, A&P acquired Michigan-based Farmer Jack; also, A&P attempted to expand into Europe by bidding unsuccessfully for the Gateway Corporation (then the United Kingdom's third-largest grocery chain), although they did open stores in the Netherlands, which they operated until the early 2000s. At the end of the decade, A&P reported a profit of 1.3% (compared to an industry average of 1.04%) on sales of $11 billion.
In the early 1990s, A&P started to struggle again because of the economy and new competition, especially Walmart. In 1992, A&P's sales dropped to $1.1 billion; it posted a loss of $189 million. A&P responded by strengthening its private label program and overhauling its remaining U.S. units. Most stores smaller than 40,000 square feet (4,000 m2) were expanded, closed, or replaced with units from 50,000 square feet (5,000 m2) to 80,000 square feet (7,000 m2). The new stores included pharmacies, larger bakeries, and more general merchandise.
A&P continued to suffer in the South and abandoned most of the region by pulling out of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia. Most of these stores were sold to Kroger. As a result, A&P was reduced to four regions: the Northeast, the Midwest (Michigan and Wisconsin), New Orleans, and Ontario. To reinforce the New Orleans division, A&P purchased six Schwegmann supermarkets; however, A&P was now reduced to 600 stores. Christian W.E. Haub, the youngest son of Erivan, became co-CEO in 1994 and CEO in 1997 when Wood retired from that post. In 2001, Wood also retired as chairman, with Haub assuming that title as well.


=== 2001–2015: Final years as a supermarket chain ===

Nationwide, Walmart gained a dominant position in the grocery industry, forcing much of the competition to downsize, though in A&P's core Northeast region, Walmart still had not become a major grocery competitor. In 2003, after declaring its largest loss, A&P closed Kohl's Food Stores and A&P's remaining stores in Vermont and New Hampshire, reducing it to just over 500 stores. Also in 2003, A&P spun off the Eight O'Clock Coffee division (its last manufacturing operation) to Gryphon Investors for $107 million. (In 2006, Gryphon sold Eight O'Clock Coffee to Tata Global Beverages for $220 million).
In 2005, A&P sold its 237-store Canadian division (consisting of A&P, Dominion, Ultra Food and Drug stores, as well as the Canadian Food Basics units) to Montreal-based Metro Inc. for Can$1.7 billion in cash plus shares of Metro. By 2009, the A&P name disappeared from these stores. In 2007, A&P closed its New Orleans division, limiting A&P's footprint to the Northeast. Also in 2007, A&P acquired Pathmark, a long-time Northeastern rival, for $1.4 billion (~$1.98 billion in 2023). With this purchase, A&P again became the largest supermarket operator in the New York City area. At the same time, Tengelmann reduced its shares to 38.5%, while the private equity firm Yucaipa, as major shareholder of Pathmark, acquired 27.5% of A&P's shares. In 2012, A&P emerged from bankruptcy by becoming a private company, as Tengelmann ended its holding, and briefly returned to modest profitability in 2013 and 2014.
This allowed A&P to regain its position as the largest grocery retailer in the New York City area, and the second-largest in the Philadelphia area. However, the Federal Trade Commission declared that as a result of the acquisition, A&P would be a monopoly in parts of Long Island and Staten Island. As part of its settlement with the FTC, the corporation was forced to divest of some Waldbaum's and Pathmarks.
When A&P marked its 150th anniversary in 2009, it was ranked only No. 21 by Supermarket News of the top 75 North American grocery retailers based on 2008 fiscal year estimated sales of US$9.6 billion (~$13.3 billion in 2023). Tengelmann held approximately 38.5 percent of A&P, with Yucaipa holding a 27.5 percent share; the rest was held by individual shareholders and investor groups. Christian Haub was chairman. Eric Claus, then president and CEO, left A&P, with Sam Martin assuming these responsibilities.


==== First Chapter 11 bankruptcy (2010) ====

The 2008 recession hit many supermarkets as customers migrated to discount markets in even greater numbers. A&P was especially hard hit because of its increased debt load to complete the Pathmark purchase. In June 2010, A&P stopped paying $150 million (~$205 million in 2023) in rent on the closed Farmer Jack stores. In August, A&P announced that it would close another 25 stores in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania: 13 Pathmarks, 6 A&Ps, 2 Waldbaum's, and 4 Super Fresh stores. In September, A&P announced it was selling seven Connecticut stores to Big Y.
On December 10, 2010, bankruptcy rumors surfaced; A&P stock tumbled from over $3 per share to below $1 before trading was halted. Two days later, A&P announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to documents submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, New York, A&P listed over $2.5 billion in assets, and $3.2 billion in debt.
After the filing, A&P remained in operation (with its stock symbol changed to GAPTQ) while it developed a reorganization plan. In November 2011, the corporation announced that it had entered into an agreement to receive $490 million (~$655 million in 2023) of debt and equity financing from Yucaipa, Mount Kellett Capital Management, and investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The agreement enabled A&P to complete its restructuring and emerge from Chapter 11 as a private entity in early 2012. At this time, Christian Haub left A&P, and Tengelmann wrote off its books the remaining equity.


==== Second Chapter 11 bankruptcy and supermarket shutdown ====
A&P briefly returned to modest profitability by cutting costs in its remaining stores, although customer spending further decreased. In 2013, again a company, A&P was put up for sale but could not find a suitable buyer. In January 2014, Sam Martin resigned. In March, Paul Hertz was named CEO and President as the company broke even. On January 15, 2015, the trade publication Supermarket News reported that A&P was still for sale.
There were rumors of several parties being interested, including Cerberus, still owning Albertsons assets. However, no suitable offers were received. In May, rumors emerged that A&P was in more financial trouble as it declared a huge loss (in April) for the previous year, losing more business to better-managed competition. As customers were staying away, A&P considered its second bankruptcy filing in less than five years.
There were rumors that A&P would sell all stores more than 40 miles from its corporate offices, shrinking the company to about 100 stores. Other rumors were that the company would sell all its stores. Rumors also surfaced about a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and total liquidation, selling the company in pieces, as well as a Chapter 11 bankruptcy with selling in pieces. The company remained for sale as a whole, receiving no bids for any of its stores. Other alternatives were explored, including selling other assets.
On July 19, 2015, A&P filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, immediately closing 25 underperforming stores. The next day, A&P announced that 76 of its stores (including Super Fresh and Pathmark units, as well as one Food Emporium unit) had been sold to Albertsons (owner of Philadelphia-based Acme Markets). Stop & Shop purchased 25 units, mainly Pathmarks in New York City, Nassau and Suffolk counties. The Key Food co-operative acquired 23 units, mainly in New York City, including all remaining Food Basics and Food Emporium stores.
Morton Williams acquired two Food Emporium stores in Manhattan, while Wakefern Food Corporation, the cooperative which runs ShopRite and PriceRite, acquired 12 units, including 9 Pathmark stores. Local grocers also acquired units either through sales or auctions. All supermarkets were closed by November 25 (Thanksgiving eve). The last remaining portion of A&P, Best Cellars at A&P, had its stores auctioned in summer 2016, with 11 stores sold (none as going concerns) and 6 leases rejected.


== Store design ==

The A&P Historical Society describes early stores as "resplendent emporiums" painted in vermilion and equipped with a large gas light T sign. Interiors included crystal chandeliers, tin ceilings, and walls with gilt-edged Chinese panels. A clerk stood behind a long counter to serve customers (self-service did not become common until the 1930s), and the cashier's station was shaped like a pagoda. When A&P started offering premiums, the wall opposite the counter was equipped with large shelves to display the giveaways.
After John Hartford became responsible for marketing in the 1900s, A&P began offering S&H Green Stamps to free space for the expanded line of groceries available in the stores. The economy stores John Hartford developed in 1912 eliminated frills. Typically 600 square feet (56 m2), these stores were equipped with basic shelving and a small ice box. A&P agreed only to short leases so that it could quickly close unprofitable stores.
In the early 1920s, A&P opened combination grocery/meat/produce stores eventually converting into supermarkets in the 1930s. On average, each supermarket replaced six older combination stores. A&P's policy of agreeing only to short-term leases resulted in differences in store design into the 1950s. During the mid-20th Century A&P stores were considerably smaller in size than those of other chains. As late as 1971, half of the A&P stores were under 8,000 square feet (740 m2).
During the Scott era, store design was modernized and controlled from headquarters. A&P developed four different-sized prototypes: 23,000 square feet (2,100 m2), 28,000 square feet (2,600 m2), 30,000 square feet (2,800 m2), and 32,000 square feet (3,000 m2). Family Mart stores were combination grocery/drug units with 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) of floor space.


=== Futurestore ===
During the Wood era, A&P developed the "Futurestore" concept; these supermarkets used black-and-white decor. Family Mart would serve as the testbed for the concept design.
Futurestore was one of two concepts A&P launched during the 1980s (the other being Sav-A-Center; also defunct). Futurestore's first supermarket was in the New Orleans area in 1984, where A&P converted two Kroger stores it had acquired. The first conversion of an A&P to the Futurestore format was in New Jersey in 1985.
The Futurestore concept spread to A&Ps in the southeastern US, plus its traditional Mid-Atlantic region (operating in the Philadelphia area under the Super Fresh name), but, in the late 1980s, all Futurestores had been re-branded, or closed.
Like its sibling supermarket, Sav-A-Center, A&P Futurestore was identified by its features and color scheme. The Futurestore interior was black and white, compared to the green and white of Sav-A-Center stores. Most Futurestores also had a glass atrium storefront. In addition, Futurestore signage featured pictograms, similar to those of European supermarkets.
Futurestores typically offered the latest in gourmet departments and electronic services in exclusive neighborhoods. Futurestore's amenities were more gourmet- and specialty-oriented than found at a traditional A&P or Sav-A-Center supermarket. Futurestores also had more modern fixtures and machinery than A&Ps had at the time.
Since the concept was never adopted for a widespread rollout, A&P phased out the Futurestore nameplate, closing some stores and converting others to A&P or Sav-A-Center. Many customers felt Futurestore did not have the same panache of other upscale food retailers, which not only offered more gourmet products, but also cooked and delivered it. A&P, however, did not immediately change the interior of the Futurestores, unlike its Sav-A-Centers, after A&P began to rebrand them as A&P Food Markets in the 1990s.


=== Pharmacies ===
In the mid-1990s, A&P began adding pharmacies, concentrating on building units of 45,000 square feet (4,200 m2) to 65,000 square feet (6,000 m2).


=== Overseas ventures ===
In the early 1980s there was discussion for A&P to open a store in Saudi Arabia. A&P Preservation reported in March 2018 that A&P did open a store in Saudi Arabia, in Riyadh. Tengelmann Representative Petra Czech says that the name was licensed to Saudi operators. The store was most likely converted to the Saudi rendition of Safeway.


== Store names ==

For most of its history, A&P operated its stores under that name. That changed during the Scott and Wood eras when A&P created chains, or used the original names of acquired chains. The following were A&P's retail operations under a different name:

Family Mart: Started in 1977, this chain of large grocery stores/pharmacies was based on similar units built by Skaggs-Albertson's when A&P Chairman Scott worked for the latter. Initially successful, within 10 years Family Mart opened 28 units in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. The 18 Family Marts in Florida were sold in 1987 and the remaining Family Marts were closed by 1999.
Plus: In Germany, Tengelmann operated many small stores under the Plus name, focusing on low-cost no-frills operations. After acquiring a majority stake of A&P, Tengelmann converted some of A&P's smaller stores to the Plus concept.
Super Fresh: When A&P announced the closure of its Philadelphia division (which included Delaware, Maryland, and southern New Jersey) during the 1981–82 restructuring, the unions offered to buy many of these stores. A&P agreed; the corporation and the unions settled on a new labor agreement that included a profit-sharing provision. The agreement also called for the stores to be operated under a new name, Super Fresh. These stores proved to be profitable, and in 1986 the name was extended to supermarkets in the District of Columbia, and Virginia; the latter included Richmond-area Pantry Pride stores A&P purchased in 1981. Super Fresh stores were still in operation when A&P began liquidation. In the subsequent auction, Super Fresh brand was acquired by Key Food and later re-launched, primarily in and around Newark, New Jersey, rather than its original Philadelphia footprint.
Food Basics (US & CA): In the early 2000s when the recession was hitting formerly prominent middle class areas, A&P had recorded record losses for stores in New Jersey suburbs such as Paterson, North Bergen, and Glassboro. A&P quickly turned around these unprofitable stores into a no-frills supermarket, called Food Basics. It offered the bare staples in the grocery department at a lower price. The stores featured both the America's Choice and Food Basics storebrands, as well as the normal name brand items other A&P-owned stores sold. By 2010, Food Basics operated more than a dozen stores in lower-class New Jersey cities, and several Super Fresh-turned-Food Basics stores in Central Philadelphia. The stores had no service departments except for a service deli. All other meats, seafood, and baked goods were produced off-premises, which cut A&P's labor costs in these stores by more than 50%, by taking out the higher-paying jobs of a butcher and baker, and replacing them with more stock clerks and cashiers.
Kohl's Food Stores: A&P acquired the Wisconsin-based Kohl's Food Stores in 1983 after closing A&P's large Chicago division in 1982. The first Kohl's opened in 1946; during the 1960s it expanded into department stores. In 1972, Kohl's was purchased by British American Tobacco, which decided to spin off the grocery stores to A&P a decade later. A&P closed Kohl's Food Stores in 2003.
Dominion (Canada): In 1985, A&P acquired the Dominion chain in Canada, consisting of 92 supermarkets, 2 warehouses, and an office complex. Dominion was sold in 2005.
Ultra Food & Drug / Miracle Mart / The Barn Markets (Canada): A&P acquired these two supermarket chains in Canada, and operated them until the chain's demise in the early 2000s, and operated out of the same store styles of its counterparts.
The Food Emporium: Also in 1985, this 26-store New York City-based chain was acquired by A&P. Founded in 1919 as Daitch Crystal Dairies (later becoming Shopwell Supermarkets), the chain peaked at 103 stores in 1962. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Shopwell closed many of its stores and changed its name to The Food Emporium to focus on affluent areas. Food Emporium stores were still in operation through A&P's liquidation; Key Food acquired The Food Emporium and four stores, along with the Super Fresh brand, in the liquidation, maintaining use of the brands today.
Waldbaum's was acquired in 1986. The New York City-based chain was founded in 1904 and opened its first supermarket in 1951. The company quickly expanded from the city into Nassau and Suffolk counties, and later into Connecticut and Massachusetts. In the early 2000s, A&P operated 80 Waldbaum's in southernmost New York state (outside Manhattan). Many Waldbaum's were still in operation when the company started liquidation, mainly in the Long Island area.
Farmer Jack was a 79-store supermarket chain based in Detroit; it was purchased by A&P in 1989. Farmer Jack started in 1924; in the mid-1950s its name was changed to Borman's. These stores were renamed Farmer Jack in the late 1960s. In 1987, Farmer Jack was depleted of cash in a lengthy strike; it was sold in 1989 to A&P for $76 million. Within five years, all A&Ps in the Detroit area were converted to Farmer Jack, as were some A&Ps in Virginia and South Carolina. By 2007, all Farmer Jack stores were sold or closed.
Sav-A-Center: The Sav-A-Center name was first used for a chain of 20 supermarkets in the greater New Orleans, Louisiana, area. The division operated throughout Louisiana, and had two stores in Mississippi. In addition, the Sav-A-Center division included three regular A&P stores, one of which was a small "corner grocery" in the French Quarter of New Orleans that A&P had been operating since 1931. By August 2005, Sav-A-Center operated primarily in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans metropolitan areas, and along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Many stores sustained damage as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Twenty-one stores reopened within a few months of the storm; two others following remodeling to repair flood damage. Five stores were closed permanently due to severe damage to the stores and surrounding areas. In April 2007, the chain exited the Baton Rouge area. On May 30, 2007, A&P confirmed that it was planning to exit the New Orleans area, and was seeking buyers for its 20 remaining Sav-A-Center stores. A&P said the company cited its decision to focus on its remaining operations in the Northeast, where it operated the majority of its stores. It was announced in September 2007 that the remaining Sav-A-Center stores would be sold to the locally owned Rouses chain. Rouses took over 16 Sav-A-Center stores, including the Mississippi stores and the French Quarter A&P, sold one to competing chain Breaux Mart, and closed the others.
Pathmark was a large New York-area chain that was one of A&P's major competitors when it was acquired in 2007. Pathmark, originally known as Supermarkets General, was formed in 1956 as a subgroup of the Wakefern co-operative known as ShopRite. When Supermarkets General broke from ShopRite in 1968, it converted its 81 stores to Pathmark. By 1977, Pathmark started to build larger stores with pharmacies. To overcome a hostile takeover in 1987, Pathmark's management instituted a leveraged buyout of $2.7 billion that committed it to make large debt payments. In 2000, Pathmark entered bankruptcy; after it was reorganized, Yucaipa Holding purchased 40% of Pathmark for $150 million. At the time of its 2007 purchase by A&P, Pathmark operated 141 stores and had a capitalization of $634 million. Many Pathmark stores were still in operation when A&P began liquidation. The brand has been sold to Foodtown, and in April 2019, a revived Pathmark (owned by Allegiance Retail Services) had opened in the  East Flatbush section of Brooklyn.


== Private brands ==

When A&P was founded, there were no branded food products, and retailers sold food commodities in bulk. In 1870, the company became among the first to sell a branded pre-packaged food product, introducing "Thea-Necter" brand tea. In 1885, the name "A&P" was introduced on baking powder containers. Also in the 1880s, the company adopted the name "Eight-O'Clock" for its coffee. When A&P moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1907, it included a bakery and coffee-roasting operation.
A&P's evolution into one of the country's largest food manufacturers was the result of the 1915 court decision in the Cream of Wheat litigation that upheld the right of a manufacturer to set retail prices. To keep prices down, A&P put emphasis on private label goods. By 1962, A&P operated 67 plants before consolidating many of them into the 1.5 million-square foot Horseheads facility, which was the largest food manufacturing plant in the world under one roof. In his 1952 book, American Capitalism, John Kenneth Galbraith cited A&P's manufacturing strategy as a classic example of countervailing power that was a welcome alternative to state price controls.
As late as 1977, private label represented 25% of A&P's sales, with A&P manufactured products accounting for over 40% of this total. That year, A&P manufacturing reported sales of $750 million from its 23 plants(which by itself would have ranked A&P's manufacturing group at about number 350 in the Fortune 500).
Until the creation of a combined Manufacturing Group in 1975, the corporation's production operations were conducted by four separate divisions:

Bakery (Grandmother's, Marvel, and Jane Parker): Until 1923, Jersey City was A&P's only bakery. A&P rapidly expanded the division until it was America's largest baker, with 37 plants. By 1977, the number of bakeries was reduced to seven; the division was closed during the 1981–82 restructuring. A Canadian baker continued to make Jane Parker cakes, but went bankrupt in 2014. Alex and Chris Ronacher took over the rights in 2016.
Coffee (Eight O'Clock, Bokar, Red Circle): In 1919, A&P consolidated its coffee business into the "American Coffee Company", building roasting and grinding facilities. By 1977, A&P owned three coffee roasting plants, and one for canned coffee. The coffee operation survived the 1981–82 restructuring, not sold until 2003.
Dairy: This division dates to 1922 when A&P purchased the White House Milk Company of West Bend, Wisconsin, to produce evaporated milk. At that time, grocers rarely sold fresh milk because of the lack of refrigeration. By 1977, the division operated three dairies, a cheese plant, and a dry milk plant.
Grocery (Quaker Maid, Ann Page, Our Own Tea): In 1907, A&P opened a vegetable cannery. After World War I, A&P took advantage of the collapse of canned salmon prices to acquire canneries in Alaska. A&P then acquired facilities to produce a wide range of canned goods, frozen foods, nuts, tea bags, pasta, peanut butter, detergents, insecticides, gelatin, paper goods, and candy. A&P also operated a printing plant to produce labels and packaging for the other facilities, and promotional material for the stores. By 1977, A&P operated the Horseheads plant, plus six smaller facilities.
In the mid-1990s, A&P introduced a new simplified store brand called America's Choice, which would last until the chain's demise in 2015. (In Canada, the brand was called "Master Choice". This same branding was used for A&P's gourmet items in its U.S. stores.)
In 2008 and 2009, the corporation added the environmentally-sensitive Green Way brand, gourmet Food Emporium Trading Company brand, and low-cost Food Basics alternative.


== Woman's Day ==
What became Woman's Day was started by A&P in 1931, as a free leaflet with menus. In 1937, it was expanded into a magazine that was sold exclusively in A&P stores, for 5 cents. Circulation reached 3 million in 1944 and 4 million by 1958, when the magazine was sold to Fawcett Publications.

In the fifth season episode of Psych, "Not Even Close... Encounters", it is shown that Lassiter has a physical "crap list". One person on the list is "Check out Girl @ the A&P", but that may be an old grudge as there were no A&Ps in California anymore at the time of the episode's airing.

=== A&P (short story) ===
"A&P" is a tragicomic work of short fiction by John Updike which first appeared in the July 22, 1961 issue of The New Yorker. The story was collected in Pigeon Feathers in 1961, published by Alfred A. Knopf. The work is frequently included in anthologies.


== Plot ==
Sammy, a teenage clerk in an A&P grocery, is working the cash register on a hot summer day when three pretty young women about his age enter, in bathing suits and bare feet, to buy snacks. Sammy gawks at the girls; he imagines details about the girls based on their appearance alone, impressions that, to his surprise, are shaken when the leader of the trio, an enchantingly gorgeous beauty he dubs "Queenie", speaks in a voice unlike that which he had created in his imagination.
Lengel, the prudish store manager, feels the girls are not dressed appropriately for a supermarket, and admonishes them, telling them they must have their shoulders covered next time, which Sammy believes unnecessarily embarrasses them.
Offended by the manager's disregard for their dignity, Sammy ceremoniously removes his store apron and bow tie and resigns on the spot, despite the mention by the manager that he believes Sammy's resignation is for rash reasons and to reconsider. Lengel also reminds Sammy he knows Sammy's parents and he ought not do anything that would embarrass them socially. Sammy then leaves the store, seemingly in expectation of some display of affection or appreciation from the young women involved, only to find that they've already left, apparently oblivious to his presence. Sammy then feels a sense of dread, reflecting on "how hard the world was going to be to me hereafter".


== Reception ==
M. Gilbert Porter called the titular A&P in Updike's story "the common denominator of middle-class suburbia, an appropriate symbol for [the] mass ethic of a consumer-conditioned society". According to Porter, when the main character chooses to rebel against the A&P he also rebels against this consumer-conditioned society, and in so doing he "has chosen to live honestly and meaningfully". Conversely,  William Peden called the story "deftly narrated nonsense ... which contains nothing more significant than a checking clerk's interest in three girls in bathing suits."


== Theme ==
Sammy, the teenage cashier, "a martyr for beauty", stalks off the job after his manager ejects the bathing suit-clad girls from the store, in particular "Queenie", the prettiest of the three. Literary critic Mary Allen comments on Updike's conception of the ideal female:

Sexuality is far and away the most desirable trait in a woman, perhaps the only essential one. It is not necessarily associated with physical beauty. A woman in Updike may be remembered as pretty because of the fondness with which the love scenes are portrayed... In fact, a case can be made that homeliness of a sort that makes a woman soft and vulnerable is itself an attraction for Updike men.
Allen adds: "The very sight of women gives a kind of grace to existence for Updike men. A young grocery checker in 'A&P' grows faint with delight when three girls in bathing suits come into the market. The loveliest girl, whose straps hang charmingly off her white shoulders, comes through his line and pays her bill with a dollar she produces from the top of her bathing suit."
Updike's 19-year-old protagonist is quickly disabused as to the wisdom of his recklessness on behalf of the girls. Literary critic Richard Detweiler writes:

The undertone of sorrow resides in the depressing sight that awaits Sammy outside the supermarket: the girls for whom he has gallantly sacrificed his job have disappeared; in their place is a young married woman yelling at her spoiled children, a much commoner refrain to the heady tunes of wishful American romance.


== Character profiles ==


=== Lengel ===
Manager of the local A&P, Lengel is a man who spends most of his days behind the door marked "Manager". Entering the story near the end, he represents the system: management, policy, decency, and the way things are. But he is not a one-dimensional character. He has known Sammy's parents for a long time, and he tells Sammy that he should, at least for his parents' sake, not quit his job in such a dramatic, knee-jerk way. He seems truly concerned even while he feels the need to enforce store policy.


=== Queenie ===
"Queenie" is the name Sammy gives to the gorgeous girl who leads her two friends through the grocery store in their bathing suits. He has never seen her before but immediately becomes infatuated with her. He comments on her regal and tantalizing appearance. She is objectified by 19-year-old Sammy, who notes the shapely contours of her figure and the seductiveness of the straps that have slipped off her shoulders. He also, however, clearly admires how her inappropriate attire defies convention. When Lengel chastises the girls for their attire, Queenie, who Sammy imagines lives in an upper-middle-class world of backyard swimming pools and fancy appetizers, becomes "sore now that she remembers her place, a place from which the crowd that runs the A&P must look pretty crummy". Sammy becomes indignant at Lengel's treatment of the girls and tries to help them save face by quitting his job. But Queenie appears not to notice and leaves the store promptly, diminishing the impact of Sammy's impulsive gesture.


=== Plaid and Big Tall Goony Goony ===
These are the nicknames Sammy gives Queenie's friends, who are somewhat uneasier about their attire. Plaid is a plump, pretty girl in a plaid two-piece bathing suit; Big Tall Goony Goony is cynically observed by Sammy to have the sort of striking features other girls pretend to admire because they know she's no real competition to them (although he concedes that she's not bad-looking on the whole).


=== Sammy ===
Sammy's name is not revealed to the reader until the end of the story, even though he is the first-person narrator of the story. He is a checkout clerk at an A&P supermarket. His language indicates that, at age 19, he is both cynical and romantic. He notes, for instance, that there are "about twenty-seven-old freeloaders" working on a sewer main up the street, and he wonders what the "bum" in "baggy gray pants" could possibly do with "four giant cans of pineapple juice". Yet when Queenie approaches him at the checkout, Sammy notes that "with a prim look she lifts a folded dollar bill out of the hollow at the center of her nubbled pink top. ... Really, I thought that was so cute." He vacillates back and forth between these extremes of opinion during the story, calling some of his customers "houseslaves in pin curlers", yet he is sensitive enough that when Lengel makes Queenie blush, he feels "scrunchy inside". At the end of the story, he quits his job in an effort to be a hero to the girls and as a way of rebelling against a strict society. In a sudden moment of insight—an epiphany—he realizes "how hard the world was going to be to [him] hereafter" if he refuses to follow conventional paths.


=== Stokesie ===
Stokesie is a 22-year-old white man who is married with two children. He works with Sammy at the A&P checkout, and is the only other store checker mentioned. He is a minor character in the story, but seems to be representative of ritualism; Stokesie seems to be a medium between the temperaments of Sammy and Lengel. He shares Sammy's askew views to some extent, but does have ambition that one day he can take over the store when Lengel dies or retires, but thinks it is probably out of the question until 1990 when there is Soviet takeover of the United States. (Ironically, 1990 in real time being one year after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the USSR was on its last gasp of being a superpower.) However, Stokesie does his job faithfully each day in order to provide for his wife and kids. Like Sammy, he also observes the girls in the store with interest, although not to the point he is fully distracted. Other customers have been filling up Stokesie's aisle when the girls come to make their purchase, leaving Sammy free. He is a glimpse of what Sammy's future might be like; Stokesie's family "is the only difference" between them, Sammy comments.

=== A&P Canada ===
A&P Canada Company was a Canadian supermarket company that operated from 1927 until 2009, when its stores were rebranded under the Metro name by Metro Inc.


== History ==

In 1927, A&P opened its first stores in Canada. By 1929, A&P was present in 200 communities in Ontario and Quebec.
A&P Canada left the Quebec market in 1984, and in 1985 acquired Dominion Stores in Ontario. It acquired Steinberg's Ontario grocery store chains Miracle Food Mart and Ultra Food&Drug in 1990 when the company divested them under new management (Miracle Mart rebranded by 1994 and Ultra by 2008).
In 1999, it acquired the Barn Markets, based in Hamilton, Ontario, and opened its first discount grocery store, Food Basics.
In 2005, A&P Canada Co. operated 135 stores under the banners of: A&P, Dominion and Ultra Food & Drug, in addition to The Barn Markets and Food Basics.  It employed over 34,000 employees in Ontario.
On July 19, 2005, Metro Inc. announced that it had reached an agreement with The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc. and its subsidiary, A&P Luxembourg S.à.r.l., to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of A&P Canada, for an acquisition price of $1.7 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion in cash and $500 million in the form of treasury shares of Metro. The sale was completed on August 15, 2005.
On August 7, 2008, Metro announced it would invest $200 million consolidating the company's conventional food stores under the Metro banner. Over a period of 15 months, all Dominion, A&P, Loeb, The Barn and Ultra banners were converted to the Metro name. Food Basics stores were not directly affected because they compete in the discount food segment, but did see A&P's Master Choice store brand replaced with Metro's Selection and Irresistibles brands.

=== A&P Food Stores Building ===
The A&P Food Stores Building is an Art Deco–style commercial building designed by Saum Architects in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. Built in 1940, it was one of the few small commercial buildings in St. Louis designed in the Art Deco style. The building was also significant as having been one of the first supermarkets in St. Louis that was developed to serve automobile-owning customers, providing parking and convenient "one-stop shopping".: 13 
There were as many as 84 A&P stores in the city, 20 being supermarkets and the others being cash and carry stores; this building is one of the last surviving of these, and it was among those which kept operating up until A&P entirely left the city in 1979–1980.: 18 
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

=== A&P Group ===
A&P Group Ltd is the largest ship repair and conversion company in the UK, with three shipyards located in Hebburn, Middlesbrough and Falmouth. The company undertakes a wide variety of maintenance and repair work on commercial and military ships with projects ranging from a two-day alongside repair period through to multimillion UK pound conversion projects lasting for a year or more.


== History ==
The company was established in 1971 as A&P-Appledore International Ltd (APA), a joint venture technology transfer consultancy between British shipbuilding companies Austin & Pickersgill and Appledore Shipbuilders, and focused on ship design and construction. Initially the business was directed towards the growing Far East market, as well as the Americas and Europe. Based on the production engineering solutions developed for the innovative 'ship factory' at Appledore in the late 1960s, and subsequently at Pallion, Sunderland, APA developed the formal Build Strategy approach.  This was taken up by Hyundai when they developed the first modern shipyard in South Korea at Ulsan in the 1970s.  The Build Strategy template was subsequently adopted in British Shipbuilders' other shipyards, and in the USA.
Following sale of Appledore Shipbuilders to the Government at the time of the collapse of its parent Court Line in 1974, and the subsequent nationalisation of Austin & Pickersgill in 1977, the shareholding of APA was purchased by its management. APA acquired the shiprepair facilities of Falmouth Docks & Engineering Company in 1984 and they remain one of the company's two major centres. The Company subsequently focused on shiprepairs rather than shipbuilding, becoming A&P Group in 1995 and being acquired by Royal Bank Development Capital in 1997.
Over the years the company has operated shiprepair facilities in many parts of the world. From the mid-1970s until privatisation in 1994, the Neorion shiprepair yard on Syros was managed for the Greek Government. Dubai Drydocks opened in 1983 under APA management. 
The takeover of the former naval dockyard at Gibraltar as "Gibrepair" in 1985 was short-lived, a victim of local social politics.
In 2001 the A&P acquired Cammell Laird's shipyards at Birkenhead, Teesside and Tyneside. In 2005 A&P sold the Birkenhead yard to Northwestern Shiprepairers & Shipbuilders and closed its facilities in Southampton (King George V Dock) and the four-dock complex in Wallsend, near  Newcastle upon Tyne, in order to focus all ship repair activity in its newer facilities in Hebburn (A&P Tyne). A&P Tees at Middlesbrough was retained to support the important Southern North Sea offshore oil and gas operations and dredging contractors; the strategically situated Falmouth operation (A&P Falmouth) was also retained.
In 2009 A&P was fully acquired by Cardiff property developer Bailey Group; that company had previously acquired a 50% stake in 2006.  In 2011 A&P Group was acquired by Atlantic & Peninsula Marine Services, which also has an interest in Cammell Laird.


== Operational centres ==
As one of only two remaining significant commercial ship repair companies in the United Kingdom, along with Cammell Laird, A&P Group has become a centre of excellence for ship owners and managers operating in North West Europe and continues to grow a profitable and successful business employing over 1,000 skilled staff (678 employees in 2013 plus agency workers) in the North East and South West of England.


=== A&P Tyne ===

A&P Tyne is located at Hebburn on the River Tyne, Tyne and Wear. The facility consists of two dry docks (only one is currently in use), two quays and a large steel fabrication shed. The facility also has eight cranes lifting up to 100 tonnes, a steel workshop, joinery workshop and engineering workshop.
The dry dock at A&P Tyne is the largest on the east coast of the UK. It is 259 metres (850 ft) long, 45.7 metres (150 ft) wide and has a depth of 5.6 metres (18 ft) below the datum of navigational charts allowing it to accommodate a wide variety of ships. The two quays are Bede Quay and West Quay.


=== A&P Tees ===
A&P Tees was located in Middlesbrough, on the River Tees. The yard had two dry docks and six cranes ranging up to forty tonnes lifting capacity. Dry dock number one was 175.4 metres (575 ft) long, 23.4 metres (77 ft) wide and had a depth of 1.7 metres (5 ft 7 in) below chart datum. Dry dock number two was 120 metres (390 ft) long, 18.6 metres (61 ft) wide and a had a depth below chart datum of 0.37 metres (1 ft 3 in). Like A&P Tyne, A&P Tees had a wide variety of workshops and fabrication sheds around the site. In mid-2024 A&P Group ceased operations at its Tees facility in a strategic move to consolidate its North East operations into its more extensive facility in Hebburn.


=== A&P Falmouth ===
A&P Falmouth is located in Falmouth, Cornwall. The yard is located in the third largest natural deep water harbour in the world, and is the largest ship repair complex in the UK. A&P Falmouth has three large graving docks and can accommodate ships up to 100,000 DWT.
Number two dock (Queen Elizabeth Dock) is the largest graving dock and is 252.8 metres (829 ft) long, 39.6 metres (130 ft) wide and a has depth below chart datum of 5.6 metres (18 ft). Dock number three is 220.98 metres (725 ft) long, 28.04 metres (92 ft) wide and a depth below chart datum of 3.2 metres (10 ft). Dock number four is 172.5 metres (566 ft) long, 26.21 metres (86 ft) wide and has a depth below chart datum of 2.9 metres (9 ft 6 in). There are four wharfs in the yard: County Wharf, Duchy Wharf, Queens Wharf and "South of Queens Wharf".
The yard has six cranes, with a total load capacity of 60 tonnes. It has also a steel fabrication shed, engineering workshop, electrical workshop and joinery workshop.

=== A&P Superintendent's House ===
The A&P Superintendent's House is a historic house in the Barelas neighborhood of Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was built in 1881 for Frank W. Smith, who used it as his base of operations while supervising construction of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad from Albuquerque to Needles, California. It is built from red sandstone, believed to have been quarried near Laguna Pueblo, which was the same material used to build the A&P's maintenance facilities on the opposite side of Second Street. Those buildings were replaced by the Santa Fe Railway Shops beginning in 1912, leaving the Superintendent's House as the city's only surviving building associated with the A&P. The house was listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1975 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.
The Superintendent's House is a one-and-a-half-story building with an intersecting gable roof and an open porch which wraps around the north and east sides. The walls are 18 inches (46 cm) thick and are constructed from sandstone blocks set in broken courses. The windows and door openings have stone lintels and sills with wood trim, and the porch features finely carved wooden pillars, cornices, and corbels ornamented with stars and arabesques. The north section of the house is side-gabled, with two dormers, and contains the living and dining rooms. The front-gabled south section contains two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen wing at the rear. The upper floor was originally constructed as servants' quarters but was later converted to a separate apartment.

=== A&P Warehouse ===
The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A&P) Warehouse, located at 67 Vestry Street, is a historic building in the Tribeca section of Lower Manhattan in New York City. Originally a storage building, it was later converted to residential use and has since been historically linked to the New York City arts scene.


== History ==
The A&P Warehouse, built for the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company grocery chain, was completed in 1897 and features a fortress-like Romanesque Revival facade. Designed by architect Frederick P. Dinkelberg as a seven-story storage building, two additional stories and an extension were eventually added. This renovation, completed in 1910, was designed by architect Frank Helme.
Many historic buildings around the A&P Warehouse, including the original A&P storefront at 31 Vesey Street, were destroyed by government-led mid-20th Century urban renewal projects. After A&P moved across the Hudson River to Jersey City, New Jersey, the warehouse was converted to loft apartments. By the 1970s artists had set up homes and studios within the lofts. Several famous 20th-Century artists, most notably  Marisol, Andy Warhol, John Chamberlain, Wim Wenders and Robert Wilson, have called the former A&P Warehouse home.
In 2014, developer Aby Rosen, 67 Vestry Street's current owner, announced that he would like to replace the structure with a 11-story residential tower. Current residents and local preservationists have formed a movement to bring landmark status to the structure to stop its demolition.

=== A&R (disambiguation) ===
A&R is a common abbreviation for artists and repertoire and also for amplification and recording.
A&R may also refer to:

A & R, Cambridge Ltd, a British hi-fi equipment manufacturer
A & R Recording, a New York recording studio
Angus & Robertson, an Australian bookseller

=== A&R Cambridge Ltd ===
A&R Cambridge Ltd. (Arcam) is a British manufacturer of hi-fi equipment based in the Cambridge Innovation Park, Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England.  It was established in 1976 by science and engineering students from the University of Cambridge. Since July 2017, it has been a part of South Korean company Samsung Electronics through its American subsidiary Harman International Industries.


== Products ==

A&R Cambridge's first product was the A60 integrated amplifier, released in 1976, which soon became a classic, admired for its restrained, sleek appearance and its high-end sound performance.  The name 'A&R Cambridge' was a shortened form of 'Amplification & Recording, Cambridge' which represented the initial operations of its founders, John Dawson and Chris Evans, who had been students at Cambridge University. In the 1980s, the name was shortened in literature to Arcam (displayed as ARCAM on products), although the company's trading name remained A&R Cambridge Ltd.

Arcam's products range from integrated stereo amplifiers to high-performance AV processors and music players. Well-known ranges include the Alpha (entry) and Delta (higher) separates of the 1980s and 90s, the FMJ (Full Metal Jacket – referring to the casing) series, and the DiVA range of stereo and AV separates (1999 to 2005).  By 2012 the range consisted of FMJ (now standing for Faithful Musical Joy) for the full size hi-fi and home cinema components, Solo for stereo music systems and rSeries for the lifestyle computer and streaming components such as the rBlink and the irDAC.
Arcam 'firsts' include the first domestic add-on audio DAC (Black Box), the first (and only) British-built Dolby S cassette deck (Delta 100 in 1992) and the first domestic DAB tuner (Alpha 10). The company was also a very early adopter of the HDMI connection standard for the outputs on its DVD players.
The company were also early adopters of the home cinema trend, launching a number of product ranges including the analogue surround sound Zeta products in the mid 1990s, followed by digital products in the Alpha, DiVA and FMJ ranges.
The ARCAM Solo, introduced in 2005, was the first system to place hi-fi quality separates into a one-box enclosure no larger than a separate CD player. This product also offered iPod integration via the rDock.  This range was extended in 2007 to include a 5.1 AV variant, and later a 2.1 version and a smaller 'Mini' version. To complete the line-up, speakers were launched to match the Solo electronics. First were the 'Alto' two-way speakers for the stereo units, then a sub/satellite speaker system called Muso/Logo was released for the AV versions.
The company introduced its first portable hi-fi product, the rCube, in 2010, offering high quality sound, an iPod docking system, wireless music streaming and an 8-hour battery life. In 2012, Arcam expanded the rSeries to include the rPAC (a Personal Audio Converter) and the drDock (a digital dock for iPad and iPhone). Arcam also introduced a new integrated amplifier, the A19. In 2013, Arcam launched a new generation of 4k-capable AV receivers, the AVR750, AVR450 and AVR380, with a matching Blu-ray player (the BDP300) optimised for music playback.  2013 also saw the launch of Arcam's first Bluetooth product, the rBlink which utilised the latest Bluecore technology from Cambridge-based CSR plc.
Engineering and design of their products is managed in-house in Cambridge, England. Arcam's competitors include, amongst others, Linn, NAD, Naim, Meridian, Audiolab, Rega Research, Marantz and Cambridge Audio.


== Ownership ==
In November 2012, Arcam became a wholly owned subsidiary of JAM industries, based in Montreal, Canada.
In July 2017, Arcam became a subsidiary of the American company Harman, itself a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics.

The first Canadian A&W restaurant opened in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1956. It spread across Canada with over 200 locations in the next ten years. The Canadian restaurants were part of the American chain until 1972 when they were sold to Unilever.
In 1975, facing competition from the growing Canadian operations of McDonald's, the company launched an advertising campaign starring an orange-clad mascot, The Great Root Bear. The bear and the tuba jingle that accompanied him became a long-running campaign (the tune, entitled "Ba-Dum, Ba-Dum", was released as a single by Attic Records, credited to "Major Ursus", a play on Ursa Major or "great bear"). The famous Canadian composer and B.C. Hall of Fame winner Robert Buckley helped compose the song. The mascot was so successful that he was eventually adopted as the mascot by the American A&W chain as well. The famous tuba jingle was played by famed Vancouver jazz, classical and session trombonist Sharman King.
In the early 1980s, the drive-in style of restaurant was phased out. It was replaced with a modern, pastel-coloured fast food outlet which included marginally healthier options. While the chain continued to open some standalone restaurants, A&W also aggressively pursued shopping mall locations, and as a result A&Ws are still commonly found in Canadian malls of various sizes.


=== Management buyout and retro theming (1995–2001) ===
In 1995, the chain was bought from Unilever by senior management. During 1997 and 1998, Drew Carey served as a spokesperson for the chain, appearing in TV ads alongside the Great Root Bear; he was dismissed (with legal action ensuing) after a November 1998 episode of The Drew Carey Show featured Carey eating at a McDonald's location in China.

By the end of the 1990s, marketing and products began to take on a more retro approach. Former menu items, such as the Burger Family, were reintroduced, and marketing became more targeted toward the baby boomer generation. The Great Root Bear and (in English Canada) the "ba-dum ba-dum" theme were also retired from most advertising (the tuba theme is still used in French-language ads). A new restaurant design was introduced, featuring a bright orange and yellow exterior, reminiscent of the 1950s, while the interior is decorated with memorabilia associated with the same period. Existing restaurants were renovated to match the new style. Meanwhile, with malls in decline, A&W began to focus on opening new standalone restaurants, particularly in smaller markets where McDonald's was often the only major hamburger chain. The last drive-in style restaurant closed in 2000, in Langley, British Columbia.


=== Stock market listing and "Good Food" focus (2002–present) ===
On February 15, 2002, the A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The initial public offering was 8.34 million units at $10 each. The fund owns the A&W trademarks in Canada and licenses them to A&W Food Services of Canada Inc. Revenue is generated by charging a three percent royalty on gross sales of each restaurant. Television advertisements are filmed at locations in the Fraser Valley. In June 2006, A&W celebrated 50 years in Canada. Some Quebec A&W locations were co-branded with Dunkin' Donuts until Dunkin' Donuts closed most locations in Quebec.

Two new restaurant concepts were introduced in the fall of 2009. The new standalone restaurant design is ultra modern but with some architectural markings reminiscent of the design in the earlier buildings erect from A&W back in time. There is also a new separate format for urban (i.e., downtown) locations, where some of the baby-boomer aspects are scaled back in favour of a more modern look. On November 21, 2013, the chain opened its 800th location in downtown Montreal. The company's advertising also shifted to a focus on animal welfare, such as chicken and beef raised without antibiotics.
In February 2018, Susan Senecal became the company's chief executive officer.
In June 2018, A&W announced that they were replacing plastic straws in their locations with paper ones, becoming the first fast food chain in North America to make the switch.
In 2019, senior executives from A&W, presenting at a conference organized by LabourWatch, were recorded sharing the anti-union measures that the franchisor allegedly takes when made aware of potential unionization activity at any franchisee or corporate-owned locations. Nancy Wuttunee, the Vice President, People Potential and Mike Atkinson, then-Regional Vice President, Eastern Canada, divulged that A&W's Home Office keeps a "'watch list' of franchises that are 'high risk for unionizing'" and that, when alerted of potential unionization efforts, Wuttunee described that the company has a “fire drill” reaction, which is "a rapid-response 'crisis management process' for responding to things that 'worry us.'" News of the presentation was released by PressProgress (a left-wing news site launched by the Broadbent Institute, a social democratic think tank in Canada). Some local politicians in Toronto, where the conference took place, criticized the company and its executives' remarks, including Toronto City Councillor Gord Perks who tweeted "Hey [A&W Canada], I'm never buying from you again, and I will tell as many people as I can to avoid you too. Canadians have a constitutional right to bargain collectively. Leave Canada." A&W continues to grow its number of locations within the province of Ontario and Atkinson is now the dedicated Vice President, Ontario.
On July 22, 2024, the company announced via press release that A&W Food Services of Canada and the A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund "have agreed to a strategic combination," which will lead to a new publicly traded QSR franchisor entitled A&W Food Services NewCo. The transaction is expected to close in October 2024, pending approval of the TSX and regulatory approval under the Competition Act (Canada).


== Products ==
Apart from the namesake brand of root beer, the A&W menu is focused on "The Burger Family", a lineup of hamburgers introduced by the U.S. A&W chain in the early 1960s, mostly discontinued in the 1980s in favour of a more standard menu, then reintroduced in Canada and expanded upon beginning in the late 1990s.


=== The Burger Family ===

The original Burger Family lineup consists of the Baby, Mama, Teen, and Papa burgers. They are still sold today along with other burgers named after other family members:

Baby Burger: small beef patty (1.6 ounces (45 g)), ketchup, unseeded hamburger bun, (optional) cheese slice
Mama Burger: regular beef patty (3 ounces (85 g)), onion slice, pickles, ketchup, mustard, Teen Sauce, sesame seed bun, (optional) cheese slice
Teen Burger: regular beef patty (3 ounces (85 g)), onion slice, pickles, ketchup, mustard, bacon, Teen Sauce, lettuce, tomato, sesame seed bun, cheese slice
Papa Burger: two regular beef patties (6 ounces (170 g) total), onion slice, pickles, ketchup, mustard, Teen Sauce, sesame seed bun, (optional) cheese slice
Grandpa Burger: three regular beef patties (9 ounces (260 g) total), onion slice, pickles, ketchup, mustard, Teen Sauce, sesame seed bun, (optional) cheese slice

Uncle Burger: large beef patty (5 ounces (140 g)), red onion slice, pickles, ketchup, Chubby mayo, Uncle Sauce, lettuce, tomato, sesame seed bun, cheese slice x2
Double Teen Burger regular beef patty (3 ounces (85 g)×2), onion slice, pickles, ketchup, mustard, bacon, Teen Sauce, lettuce, tomato, sesame seed bun, cheese slice
Discontinued members of the Burger Family include the Grandma Burger, a prime rib burger topped with caramelized onions and horseradish sauce; and the Sirloin Burger Twins, which were a pair of sliders.


=== Chubby Chicken ===
Another 1960s-era offering, Chubby Chicken, returned to the menu shortly after the reintroduction of the Burger Family.
Chubby burgers are breaded all white-meat chicken breasts. There are three varieties offered: 

The Original Chubby Burger which is made on sesame seed bun, and comes with Chubby Mayo (Hellmann's Mayo), and lettuce.
The Spicy Habanero Chicken Burger is made on a seeded bun with a spicy chicken portion, and comes with jalapeño aioli, lettuce and tomato.
BLT Chubby Burger is made on a 7-grain bun, and comes with Chubby Mayo (Hellmann's Mayo), two slices of bacon, lettuce, and tomato.
These can be ordered by themselves, or in combos. They also offer all white-meat chicken strips which come in either 3 or 5, by themselves, or in combos. The chicken strips may also be ordered in wraps such as the "Chipotle Chicken wrap" and the "Bacon Ranch wrap". Some locations used to offer fried chicken bone-in pieces however, the bone in chicken was discontinued as an optional item in 2020.


=== Value Menu ===
In 2012, A&W introduced its first value burger, the Buddy Burger, and its double patty variant, the Double Buddy burger. Both can be ordered with or without cheese. The release of the Buddy burger made A&W more competitive against McDonald's, who already had value burgers like the McDouble.
In 2015, A&W piloted the new Chicken Buddy burger at some select locations. It was successful and was added to the value menu permanently in 2016.

Buddy Burger: one or two small beef patties (1.6 ounces (45 g)), mustard, ketchup, Teen Sauce, grilled onions, unseeded hamburger bun; available in double or single patty versions, and with cheese or without cheese.
Chicken Buddy Burger: one or two breaded chicken patties, mayonnaise, pickles, unseeded hamburger bun; value burgers, available in double or single patty versions


=== Breakfast ===
A&W launched a revamped version of their breakfast offering in the summer of 2014. In addition to the Bacon N' Egger (called Chef-d'œuf in Quebec), Sausage N' Egger, and Classic Bacon N' Eggs, they launched several new items including The All-Canadian Special and pancakes. Customers can choose to have their breakfast sandwiches made with either English muffins or with buns. In 2017, A&W announced that it would offer their breakfast sandwiches as part of an
All-Day Breakfast Menu to compete with McDonald's.


=== Beyond Meat ===
In July 2018, A&W locations began serving Beyond Meat's vegan Beyond Burger. The chain had a shortage of the Beyond Burger in August 2018, but announced that all locations would receive stock by October 2018. In 2019 A&W expanded its Beyond Meat offerings with the release of the Beyond Meat Sausage N' Egger.

Beyond Meat Burger: Beyond Meat patty, mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, red onion, pickles, lettuce, tomato, sesame seed bun, A&W seasoning
Beyond Meat Sausage N' Egger: Beyond Meat sausage patty, margarine, egg, cheddar cheese, English muffin


=== Other products ===

A&W also sells their Mozza Burger, which is not part of the burger family nor the value menu. It consists of a beef patty, lettuce, tomato, bacon, mozzarella cheese, and their special Mozza sauce on a sesame seed bun.
Discontinued offerings include Bone-in Chubby Chicken (sold in 2-3 piece combos, buckets of 10, with a "family box" of fries/onion rings, and a side of potato salad/coleslaw (also discontinued options)), discontinued members of the Burger Family: Grandma Burger, a prime rib burger topped with caramelized onions and horseradish sauce; and the Sirloin Burger Twins, which were a pair of sliders, the Veggie Deluxe (veggie burger with mozzarella cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles), traditional hot dogs, and the Whistle Dog (topped with cheese and bacon).
The ketchup and mustard served at A&W location are processed by French's at their Ontario facility and use only Canadian ingredients.
The Whistle Dog, a hot dog dressed with cheese, bacon and relish, was available in Canada, but was discontinued at the end of 2016; the regular hot dog was similarly discontinued. In July 2022, all Canadian A&W locations brought back the Whistle Dog for a limited time.


=== Divergences with A&W (Great American Brand) ===
The Canadian menu diverges significantly from their international counterparts franchised through A Great American Brand. This divergence is due to the brand's separate management and ownership. The only Burger Family product available by name in U.S. locations is the Papa Burger. The Papa Burger differs significantly between Canada and the U.S. Notable products on the U.S. menu not available in Canada include deep-fried cheese curds and soft serve-based products such as sundaes.


== Animal welfare ==
The chicken and eggs served at A&W are from hens who lived in enriched cages and were fed a vegetarian diet, as chickens are omnivores. Antibiotics are only used in the company's animals when medically necessary, and those animals are taken out of production. Moreover, A&W claimed to be trying to use 100% open housing by 2021. A&W has also announced plans for their meat production to meet Global Animal Partnership's level 2 certification, but did not provide a timeline.


== Trademark ==
The A&W trademarks are owned by A&W Trade Marks Limited Partnership. The Partnership licenses the trademarks to A&W Food Services of Canada Inc. in exchange for a royalty of 3% of the sales of A&W restaurants in Canada. A&W Food Services owns ~21% of A&W Trade Marks Inc. which is the sole general partner in the Partnership, while the rest is owned by A&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund.

A&W Canada radio jingle from the late 1960s (MP3)

=== A&W (song) ===
"A&W" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter, and record producer Lana Del Rey for her ninth studio album, Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd (2023). The track was written and produced by Del Rey and Jack Antonoff, along with its co-writer Sam Dew. Released on February 14, 2023, as the album's second single, the song's title not only references the American root beer brand of the same name, but serves as an initialism for "American Whore". The beat and tone shifts midway through for a brief instrumental, before shifting again into the second part, unofficially dubbed "Jimmy" by fans and critics based on the lyrics. The song is described as a psychodrama and deep exploration of women's body, sexual assault, slut shaming, and a critique of rape culture.
It is the third song by Del Rey that mentions soda in the title—the previous two being "Cola" (2012) and "Diet Mountain Dew" (2012). She, however, has made references to soda on songs like "Bartender" (2019). The song garnered unanimous critical acclaim, immediately cited as a masterpiece and one of Del Rey's best. A&W received two nominations at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in the Song of the Year and Best Alternative Music Performance categories. It was named the best song of 2023 by several publications, including Pitchfork, The Guardian, and NME. In 2023, it was included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, becoming the most recent song to appear on the listicle, while Pitchfork named it the best song of the decade.


== Composition ==
"A&W" was written and produced by Del Rey alongside Jack Antonoff, with additional songwriting courtesy of Sam Dew. Described as a folk, pop, synth-pop, trap, boom bap and psychedelic ballad, the song is composed of two halves, which lasts a total runtime of seven minutes and thirteen seconds in the album version and a scant two minutes and twenty-two seconds in the radio edit. The first half is folk-oriented, prominently featuring acoustic guitar with intertwined supporting piano and electric guitar lines. The unusual harmony established by the piano and guitar have garnered "A&W" comparisons to the work of Nirvana. The work shifts in and out of a mixolydian flat 6 mode, notably also employed in songs like "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" by Beyoncé, which is used in "A&W" to transition keys between the sections. The second half ("Jimmy") is trap-oriented, which Rolling Stone noted for "harkening back to some of her early hip-hop-inspired productions." The second melody takes on an experimental beat, incorporating interwoven Moog bass, synth pads, 808s, Mellotron strings, and other assorted elements employed by producer Antonoff. The song contains a reference to Down Down Baby, a nursery rhyme that has been used in various songs and media productions since the mid 20th century, including the 1959 R&B song "Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko-Bop" by Little Anthony and the Imperials. The second half also notably samples her song "Norman Fucking Rockwell", similar to how an early demo of "Venice Bitch" is sampled later on Did You Know That There's a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd during the track "Taco Truck x VB". Del Rey's vocals in the second part have been referred to as rap and follow the C mixolydian mode, all while her voice is distorted by time and pitch manipulation to cause purposeful artifacting.
"A&W" drew further comparisons to the "Lizzy Grant era" of Del Rey's career, referring to the singer's early recordings, such as the 2006 demo album Sirens, which featured a signature girly, youthful timbre.
Antonoff revealed in his 2023 Mix with the Masters session that "A&W" was recorded in just two days and that the "Jimmy" section of the song was an outtake from Norman Fucking Rockwell!'s "club" concept, recorded in 2018. On March 28, 2023, four days after the release of the song's parent album, a demo recorded during Del Rey's Ultraviolence sessions titled "Earthquakes" leaked online. The song features the same interpolated lyrics as "A&W", and is believed to be another possible precursor to the song.


== Release ==
The song was released on Valentine's Day, February 14, 2023, as the album's second single. In an Instagram post announcing the album's title and release date, Antonoff teased the track, calling it his "favorite we've ever done."


== Critical reception ==
The song received universal acclaim from critics for its lyrics and experimental production. Shaad D'Souza of Pitchfork named the song "Best New Track," lauding it as a "psychedelic, collagist freakout." Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called it "classic Lana in every way imaginable," intertwining themes of "bad love" with "Americana symbolism." Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone similarly commented on the track as a "near-Lynchian" freakout which "escalates into a sexy, psychedelic, trap outro", ultimately naming it among the singer's best works. Ken Partridge of Genius described the song as a "complex character study," noting the lyrical references to other media, and the verse critiquing rape culture. Tomasz Lesniara of Paste ranked "A&W" as Del Rey's greatest song of all-time and highlighted the lyrics to be her one of her best works. Writing for The Guardian, Laura Snapes named it the song of the year, and called it "an incredible slither of detuned guitar, brooding piano and staticky detritus... it makes no sense and it’s oddly brilliant."


=== Year-end lists ===


=== Decade-end lists ===

Music aggregator site Album of the Year places "A&W" as the most critically acclaimed song of 2023, based on a critical consensus of year-end lists by 26 different publications. In 2024, Rolling Stone ranked the song 456th on its list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.

=== A&W Cream Soda ===
A&W Cream Soda is a cream soda carbonated soft drink introduced by A&W Root Beer in 1986.
A&W Cream Soda and A&W Diet Cream Soda were introduced in 1986. A&W Cream Soda is currently the top brand in cream sodas.
In 2017, the product was reformulated to be caffeine free.


== Marketing ==
In 1991, A&W had its most popular cream soda campaign. They produced a summer advertisement with Snoopy and Woodstock displayed on the entire can. Snoopy and Woodstock are characters from the Peanuts Gang comic strips written by Charles M. Schulz. Snoopy can be seen playing baseball, having a cookout, lifting weights, surfing, walking the beach, riding a bike, jumping hurdles, and listening to music. These cans were very popular among buyers. These images can be seen on regular A&W cream soda as well as Diet A&W cream soda cans.
Coca-Cola's first polar bear print advertisement made its debut in France in 1922, and for the next 70 years, polar bears appeared sporadically in print advertising.  A&W, the leading root beer marketer, filmed their own commercial using polar bears in the summer of 1992. In that commercial, a real polar bear is seen in contrast to a mechanical polar bear that is ice-skating in a fancy skirt. The commercial used the polar bears to distinguish a difference between regular A&W cream soda and sparkling A&W cream soda. They use the real bear yawning to embody the regular cream soda, and they use the ice-skating polar bear to represent the sparkling cream soda. The polar bears are used as a marketing technique to appeal to a large audience. "They are white, which is the color of innocence, even though in this case it's 800 pounds of skin-ripping innocence," Mr. Gilbert said.
Also, in 1992 Pepsi-Cola International and A&W Brands Inc. worked together over a signed agreement to increase the spread of A&W's bottled products in Asia. The company anticipated to sell $500 million of A & W soft drinks in Asia within the span of ten years to make the company's brands as prevalent as Pepsi, which was already distributed in Guam and Indonesia. In 1994, A&W put $7 million into their marketing promotions. They partnered with the show Baywatch to produce greater sales for their product. Baywatch was ranked second among all of the popular TV shows, so they knew this was a great opportunity. In-show placement on four episodes of Baywatch appeared. The advertisement was shown as sponsors of a boogie board test during the episode. The winner of the boogie board contest on the television show would receive a year's supply of A&W.
A&W cream soda also spent $1.5 million in ads commemorating "a little sparkle in a vanilla world." A new A&W campaign from New York, which featured regular people, kids to grandparents, all describing their satisfaction of A&W. The campaign took a different direction from A&W's common and past humorous ads, using sepia-toned images. Their new tag-line introduced: “authentic.” 
In addition to making A&W well known in different countries, using Snoopy, making new marketing campaigns with polar bears, and using the show Baywatch, A&W cream soda has had a few commercials. Joe Isuzu appeared in cream soda commercials as well as William Sanderson and the Sumangala Band.

=== A&W Restaurants ===
A&W Restaurants, Inc. (also known as Allen & Wright Restaurants) is an American fast food restaurant chain distinguished by its "Burger Family" combos, draft root beer and root beer floats.  A&W's origins date back to 1919 when Roy W. Allen set up a roadside drink stand offering root beer at a parade honoring returning World War I veterans in Lodi, California. Allen's employee, Frank Wright partnered with him in 1922 and they founded their first A&W restaurant in Sacramento, California, in 1923. The company name was taken from the initials of their last names – Allen and Wright. The company became famous in the United States for its "frosty mugs" – the mugs were kept in a freezer and filled with A&W Root Beer just before being served to customers.
Evolving into a franchise in 1926, the company today has over 900 locations in 16 countries, with 460 in the United States, Southeast Asian countries and Germany, serving a fast-food menu of hamburgers, hot dogs and french fries. A number of outlets serve as drive-in restaurants that have carhops. Previously owned by Yum! Brands, the chain was sold in December 2011 to a consortium of A&W franchisees through A Great American Brand, LLC. A&W restaurants in Canada have been part of a separate and unaffiliated chain since 1972.


== History ==


=== Founding and early years ===
On June 20, 1919, Roy W. Allen opened his first root beer stand in Lodi, California. The first day was for a homecoming celebration of soldiers who returned from battle in World War I. The following day, his stand was open for regular customers, selling root beer glasses for 5 cents (equivalent to $0.91 in 2024). The following year, Allen opened a second stand in Stockton, California. Shortly afterward, the effect of the period of prohibition that existed in the United States from 1920 to 1933 gave Allen and his stand with a beverage with "beer" in the name a heavy rebound. Four years later, A&W began when Allen and Frank Wright opened their drive-in restaurant in Sacramento, California, combining both of their initials for the name, and selling the root beer from Allen's stand. Curbside service was provided by tray boys and tray girls. In 1924, Allen purchased Frank Wright's stake in the business. In 1925, Allen began franchising the root beer, while the franchisee added the other menu items and operated at their discretion. Most of the restaurants that opened under this scheme were on the highways of the Central Valley region, mainly for travelers. This may have arguably been the first successful food-franchising operation. Allen sold the company in 1950 and retired.
A&W's initial menu relied heavily on root beer and snacks, such as popcorn and peanuts, as well as sandwiches on sliced bread.
In 1927, J. Willard Marriott gained franchise rights for Washington, D.C. and the neighboring cities of Baltimore and Richmond. Subsequently, he moved to Washington to open a root beer stand with Hugh Colton. These stands subsequently became Hot Shoppes, paving the way for the later creation of one of the largest hospitality corporations in the world. As of 1933, A&W had a total of 171 stands, increasing to 260 by 1941.
A&W survived the Great Depression and labor shortages during World War II but benefitted from the post-war recovery of the American economy, with fast food and drive-in restaurants beginning to take shape. The first franchise convention was held in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1949, but was limited to Wisconsin franchisees.


=== Expansion ===

In the expansion years of the 1950s and 1960s, franchisees were signing 20- or 25-year contracts under the older model. The chain expanded into Canada in 1956, opening restaurants in Winnipeg and Montreal. By 1960, A&W had 2,000 restaurants. In November 1956, F. R. "Fran" Loetterle became the president of the chain.
In 1963, the chain opened its first store on Okinawa, which at the time was under American control. In the following years, the chain branched into other foreign markets, including Guam (first territory outside of the American continent to open a restaurant, in 1961), opened by Scotty Moylan, Mexico, the Philippines (some sources say it opened in the 1990s) and Malaysia. The first restaurant in Malaysia (Malaya at the time) was opened on December 24 that year by Al and Geri Lieboff, a couple from Las Vegas, who got the franchising rights for Malaysia and Singapore. Setting up the chain seemed to be complicated, as they were unable to find a proper site, and in the recruitment process, Malayans had no consent to adorning Western "cabaret girl" style clothes. Already at the time of setup, kids were starting to favor chicken, burgers, and hot dogs rather than rice and curry, and within the next five years, would also see a rise in new locations up to 22 within five years.
The first restaurant in Europe opened in Mannheim (near Stuttgart), West Germany in 1962. At the time, a city influenced by US military presence, the restaurant was showing signs of success for its novelty, the first drive-in restaurant in Germany, and had already made headlines in German newspapers. At the time, it was the 2283rd overall founded by the chain. There were already plans to introduce restaurants and drive-ins in other key European markets, such as the United Kingdom, according to the chain's president.
Dale Mulder opened up a Lansing, Michigan A&W franchise in 1961. In 1963, Mulder added the bacon cheeseburger to his menu after a customer made repeated orders for bacon to be added to his cheeseburger. Thus A&W is credited with inventing the bacon cheeseburger.


=== United Fruit Co. and United Brands Company subsidiary ===
In 1963, the company was sold again, followed by another sale in 1967 to United Fruit Co. conglomerate. AMK Corporation purchased United Fruit in 1970. Then AMK formed United Brands Company to hold A&W.
In 1971, A&W Beverages Inc.—a beverage subsidiary—began supplying bottled A&W products to grocery stores. The bottled products would become available nationally. In 1972, A&W's Canadian division was sold to Unilever.
A&W attempted to open restaurants in mainland Japan in the early 1970s, specifically in Fukuoka prefecture and the regions of Kanto and Kansai. The chain's performance on the mainland was sluggish in contrast to Okinawa due to several factors, such as the 1973 oil crisis, prompting the chain to withdraw from the market. A&W's Japanese operations are still handled from Okinawa. There were further fruitless attempts to bring the chain to the mainland: in the 1980s, the Okinawan branch briefly attempted to open restaurants in Kagoshima Prefecture but ended up limiting itself to Okinawa, while in the 2000s a pilot restaurant existed in Tokyo, which was quickly withdrawn.
1978 saw the introduction of a standard menu for use in all restaurants in the USA.
In the 1970s, A&W had more stores than McDonald's, with a peak in 1974 of 2,400 units. Oshkosh, Wisconsin, franchise manager Jim Brajdic said: "Problems back then, including a lawsuit, franchisee discontent, and inconsistencies in the operation, caused the chain to flounder and branches to close." A&W moved to a modern-style franchise agreement that introduced royalty payments and new standards. However, many franchisees refused the revised terms as their 20- or 25-year original agreements expired. In 1980, the number of restaurants had fallen to 1,300 in the United States (mostly in the Midwest and the North West), Asia, and Europe. In 1980, the Singaporean franchisee Temenggong Ltd. had increased the number of restaurants in the country, while nine new restaurants were planned in Malaysia. There were also plans to open restaurants in the Philippines and Hong Kong.
Negotiations to sell the chain began in November 1981.


=== Taubman Investment Co. subsidiary ===
In 1982, A. Alfred Taubman purchased A&W and placed it under Taubman Investment Co. Taubman only purchased the restaurant company and not A&W Beverages. The chain dropped to fewer than 500 locations in the mid-1980s. A freeze on issuing franchises was put in place. Taubman wanted to restructure the chain by changing its "outdated" image. Franchisees were being neglected in the United Fruit phase. Taubman opted to withdraw agreements with 100 franchisees that were performing poorly and ousted 80% of its workforce. With this, the new management decided to split its fast-food restaurants into two units – the conventional orange roof A&W restaurants, which were still the majority, and A&W Great Food Restaurants.
In 1983, A&W opened its first restaurant in Thailand, at the Central Ladprao shopping mall in Bangkok.
In 1985, A&W began offering the Third Pounder to compete with McDonald's Quarter Pounder. As advertised, the Third beat the Quarter in taste tests and was less expensive by weight. In his 2007 memoir, former owner A. Alfred Taubman claimed research had revealed that it had been unsuccessful in part due to Americans' widespread innumeracy, specifically their inability to understand fractions: 1/3 was perceived as smaller than 1/4 (due to the smaller denominator) despite being a larger quantity. The burger was relaunched in 2021 as the 3/9 Pound burger, humorously attempting to capitalize on the now-popular fractions misunderstanding story.
In 1985, the chain struggled in Singapore, losing its relevance to newer, larger chains and its dominance in the fried chicken area to KFC. The chain was about to amp up its operations in the Asian region, with a possible launch in Hong Kong as well as three new restaurants in Thailand.
On April 21, 1985, its first restaurant opened in Indonesia, in the Melawai area of South Jakarta, its capital. Currently, Indonesia is the chain's largest international market, which as of February 2023 claimed 243 restaurants in 30 cities. A restaurant in Ximending, Taiwan opened on February 22, 1986. Its two units in Kuwait were closed in 1988 owing to security concerns. It was in Kuwait, during a US-Malaysia trip, that Kevin Bazner was held hostage in August 1990 when the plane he was on board was set for refueling; he was released in December.
Negotiations were held with Sonic Drive-In for a potential buying of the chain, but the plans fell in October 1986 due to a decline in franchises. Expansion plans were formulated in August 1987 with the opening of twenty new restaurants in a one-year period.
On March 6, 1988, the first conventional A&W outlet opened in the Philippines at Fiesta Carnival in Cubao, followed by a second at Gift Gate Center on November 26. The second restaurant's reputation was damaged by a fire of unknown origin that broke out in May 1990. Nonetheless, the chain expanded with new outlets and products by the end of 1990. The Philippine chain was the first A&W to introduce chicken nuggets, a product that even the American operations wanted from there. The chain also sponsored a team in the Philippine Basketball League, which they withdrew in 1992.


==== A&W Great Food Restaurants ====

A new format concept, A&W Great Food Restaurants, was developed. Ten corporate-owned locations were opened to test the concept: a sit-down, upscale, family-theme restaurant with a large salad bar and homemade ice cream. The first such branch opened in 1978 (1979, according to some sources) at the Lake Forest Shopping Mall in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Emphasis in these restaurants was made on low-calorie foods that covered almost the entirety of the foods found in the fast-food spectrum, except pizza. By 1986, there were plans to have 250 to 300 locations within ten years.

In 1987, the company was headquartered in Livonia, Michigan, and Mulder became CEO and president. The freeze was lifted, and a push occurred in 1986, adding 60 franchise units. In March 1989, A&W made an agreement with Minnesota-based Carousel Snack Bars to convert that chain's 200 stores (mostly kiosks in shopping malls) to A&W Hot Dogs & More, Some A&W Hot Dogs & More are still operating. aiming to finish the conversion within two years. In the same year, A&W bought the Burger City chain, converting its nine drive-thru kiosks to A&W units.
George E. Michel, who had worked with the Canadian chain for twenty years, was appointed president of the American A&W Restaurants in January 1991, becoming CEO in January 1992. His presidency used its long history as a pretext for nostalgia both in the United States and abroad.


=== Sale to Sidney Feltenstein; Grotech subsidiary ===
In December 1994, Taubman sold A&W to Sidney Feltenstein, with the aim of pushing the chain's international expansion further, while still maintaining its headquarters in Livonia. At the time, there were 790 restaurants (688 in the United States and 102 abroad), with the bulk of the international locations located in Malaysia, Thailand and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. Earlier in 1994, its hundredth international location opened at a tourist attraction in Bangkok: a crocodile farm. In January 1995, operations were taken over by Grotech Capital Partners, for a sum of $20 million, with Feltenstein as the chain's new CEO.
An agreement was signed in 1996 with Walmart to provide restaurants in seven locations. The menu would add items depending on the region, with the rest being its standard fare. That year, its restaurants were renovated to feature an aesthetic referred to by Feltenstein as "contemporary nostalgia". The move mirrored that of Dairy Queen, which had also opened a test location with a similar feel. A&W also operated restaurants in Monterrey, a key city in northern Mexico. In 1997, A&W acquired Carousel Snack Bars, including its 175 units in malls. The agreement made the chain the owner of these units, while continuing to franchise restaurants.
The chain aimed to increase its presence in the second half of 1996 by opening co-branded locations and nontraditional sites such as gas stations, while abroad it planned an increase in the number of units, having signed development agreements in Oman and had already opened stores in Dubai. There were also plans for the opening of units in Seoul and increasing its presence in Singapore, as well as attempting to target the Latin American market. For the Middle East, it made a licensing comeback after approximately a decade, after leaving the market in the late 80s due to political uncertainties. In early 1997, it announced the opening of locations in colleges and universities. The chain relocated its corporate headquarters to Farmington Hills on March 30, 1998. As part of an $80 million expansion plan, there were plans to open 500 restaurants in two years and close 100 outdated restaurants. A new location, which had previously housed an A&W site in Fargo from 1971 to 1980, opened in mid-March 1997 as a pilot restaurant for a new design to be implemented in new locations.

A&W entered the mainland Chinese market in 1996, the franchisee for the country being Aidewei, and had eight restaurants in Beijing. Later, due to arrears of franchise fees since 2000, Aidewei lost the A&W trademark in 2002. The eight restaurants weren't operating well and were plagued by mismanagement. An outlet in Yansha with 140 seats in a crowded, strategic location turned out to have limited business, while the restaurant in Anzhen had few customers. Following the buyout of the parent chain by Yum! Brands in 2002, it was announced in March 2003 that negotiations with Aidewei had broken down, leading to the franchisee's bankruptcy that same year. The restaurants closed successively from October 2002 to September 2003. The "father of American fast food," as dubbed by the Chinese press, didn't convince the local culture and tastes, especially with the rise of local fast food. There were also concerns about the Chinese branch operating without authorization, refusing to pay franchise fees since September 2000.
In 1997 a small A&W restaurant opened in Festivalgate in Osaka, offering standard A&W fare. The restaurant closed in 1999.
The first Qatari restaurant opened on December 18, 1997 (Qatar's National Day) with Al-Muftah Group as the franchisee. There were also plans to open a second restaurant in the country, as well as two restaurants in Cairo and six more in the UAE during 1998. The fare was similar to most A&W restaurants, with the addition of local items. At the end of the month, it opened a unit in Seoul (owned by 2F Enterprises) and one in Brunei (owned by a subfranchise of A&W Singapore). As of June 1998, A&W only had two restaurants in Mexico. The Cairo branch opened on August 1, 1998 under local franchise American Egyptian Foreign Investments, with Egypt becoming the seventeenth country outside of the United States to open a location.
The first co-branded A&W restaurant, tied with Mexican food chain Amigos, opened in Lincoln in 1997. There were plans to increase the amount of co-branded locations across Nebraska by four in the second half of 1998. The goal of the co-branded restaurant was to allure more customers who did not prefer Mexican food. On March 16 1999, it announced the opening of a restaurant in Dhaka with franchisee Global Suplies Limited due in September that year, with four more planned. The restaurant in Lodi took part in a world record for the largest root beer float of 2562.5 gallons on June 19, 1999, the eve of the eightieth anniversary of the chain. That same year, the chain attempted to enter the Korean market by finding local partners, aiming to grow in the Korean market in the first half of 2000. The plan was ultimately shelved.
A&W merged with Long John Silver's to form Yorkshire Global Restaurants based in Lexington, Kentucky in March 1999. Kevin Bazner was promoted president of the chain in July. In 2000, Yorkshire agreed to test multi-branded locations with Tricon Global Restaurants. A grocery location opened in February that year in Idaho. By March 2002, the Yorkshire-Tricon multi-branding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's, and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.
In December 2000, A&W announced new openings in less conventional locations, such as casinos, airports, gas stations, convention centers and convenience stores, for 2001, as part of its growth plans. At the time, the chain had more than 1,000 locations in 47 states and over 200 international locations in 14 countries. The chain around the time emphasized its aesthetics on "contemporized nostalgia". It also saw a success in co-branded restaurants, following the success of a trial in Butte in 1998, which, owing to its success, in the spring of 2000 led to the announcement of the opening of 300 joint KFC-A&W restaurants by 2005.
Tricon bought both A&W and LJS in March 2002, shortly before the merger with Yorkshire was finalized.


=== Yum! Brands subsidiary ===

In March 2002, Yorkshire merged with Tricon Global Restaurants to form Yum! Brands. A few weeks later, Malaysian company KUB took over the franchises in Southeast Asia, aiming to restore its prestige in Malaysia alone and increasing its market share. Subsequently, in January 2003, Yum! announced that A&W and Long John Silver's would move their operational base from Lexington to Louisville, as operating the chains from Lexington was considered "impractical and cost-inefficient", preferring to operate all of its chains from Louisville. Under Yum's management, A&W added franchises with a nostalgic look and modern technology. They have a carhop design with drive-thrus, and some have picnic tables. The chain didn't seek to compete against McDonald's, instead preferring to carve up its own niche. 2004 saw the return of the Papa Burger brand at a restaurant in Dayton - the Burger Family brand originally retired in the United States in the 1980s, being replaced by the Deluxe Burgers - and was the only name of the old line that was reinstated, with the other burgers having new names.
In September 2001 the Singapore branch was taken over by KUB, who also oversaw the restaurants in Malaysia. At the time of takeover, it had twelve restaurants, but by November 2002, the number had dwindled to eight. Its restaurants had already been downgraded: the Ang Mo Kio restaurant shut down, the Tampines restaurant refused to repair its air conditioning systems, and cable TV was switched off in all outlets. Food sales had decreased by about 5-12%. The chain quit the Philippine market in 2004 owing to several factors: lack of interest in its standard fare, lack of interest among locals, expensive cost and a general sense of unfamiliarity with local palates. The chain failed to adapt to local tastes and quietly shut down in the summer of 2004.

The chain attempted to enter large European markets thanks to joints with KFC. In Germany the first non-military A&W restaurant opened in Garbsen near Hanover on May 27, 2003 followed by a second in Cologne in July. A third in Berlin was scheduled for early September.
A&W opened its first outlet in Bangladesh on December 15, 2004. The outlet reportedly closed in 2024. Indonesia hit a record milestone, as the hundredth restaurant opened in Bintaro Utama on October 20, 2004. By the end of 2004, all A&W restaurants in the Philippines were closed.
Most A&W stores that opened in the U.S. during Yum!'s ownership were co-branded with another of Yum!'s chains—Long John Silver's, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, or KFC.
In 2009, its operations in Southeast Asia were in a mixed situation. Operations in Indonesia and Bangladesh were thriving, while the restaurants in Thailand and Malaysia were facing uncertainties. The Malaysian franchisee KUB planned to increase the number of restaurants to 60, up from 37 in 2012, despite net losses of $1.5 million. For its 90th anniversary, A&W announced an expansion plan to open fifteen new drive-ins in a concept the chain dubbed “Three-D Drive In: Drive-In, Drive-Through, Dine-In”. Growth was more expeted in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Oregon, where some of these Three-D units were set up in 2008.


=== A Great American Brand LLC ===

In January 2011, Yum! Brands announced its intention to sell A&W along with Long John Silver's. Citing poor sales for both divisions and overshadowing by its other chains, Yum! planned to focus on international expansion for its remaining brands, with particular emphasis on growth in China. In September 2011, Yum! announced that it would sell the chain to A Great American Brand, a consortium of various A&W franchisees in the United States and overseas. The sale was finalized on December 19, 2011, under the leadership of returning CEO Kevin M. Bazner. Administration of A Great American Brand was divided between the national A&W franchisee association, the largest overseas franchisee and Bazner. With the purchase, A&W relocated its headquarters back to Lexington, employing a staff of 30 in late 2011, aiming to double to 60 within a five-year period while setting a growth target after that. Potential targets for growth were going to be small towns, as well as non-conventional locations, such as shopping malls, airports and universities. The chain had 1,200 restaurants at the time, 850 of which were in the US, with the remaining primarily in Asia. The chain, instead of competing heavily against larger chains, continued to rely on its core strength, smaller cities and towns of the USA.
In early 2013, A&W introduced its first new product in several years: a six-ounce version of its soft-serve blended dessert treat. Mini Polar Swirls were the first product to be launched on Vine. The following summer, 250 of A&W's restaurants began hand-breading their chicken tenders, moving towards higher-quality menu items and expanding their chicken category. In April 2014, the Hand-Breaded Chicken Tender Texas Toast Sandwich was added to the menu as a limited-time offering, along with a campaign to create the world's longest branded hashtag. In June 2014, A&W launched two new flavors of its Polar Swirl dessert treat: Sour Patch Kids and Nutter Butter.

In October 2013, A&W opened its first new concept restaurant, A&W Burgers Chicken Floats. The new concept focuses on fresh made-to-order food and heavily emphasizes customer service. The menu features burgers made with fresh beef and a choice of toppings, hand-breaded chicken tenders, all-beef hot dogs, and several sides. The new management gave A&W a significant boost in the number of locations, with 2017 scheduled to have more openings than closures.
For 2018, A&W projected an increase in its franchising operations and opening new restaurants.
In April 2019, A&W returned to Singapore after a 16-year absence, its first location being at Jewel Changi Airport.
In June 2019, the A&W chain started moving its headquarters to the University of Kentucky Coldstream Research Campus in 2019.
A&W announced in March 2022 that it was going to withdraw from the Thai market due to economic losses. The restaurants shut down on March 20.
A franchise was given to western New York in early 2023, with three locations, the first of which in Niagara Falls, set to open between May and June of that year.
There are nearly 1,000 A&W Restaurants worldwide that are owned or franchised through A Great American Brand, with approximately 475 of these restaurants located in the U.S. as of October 2024.
A&W rebounded its profits in the first half of 2024, emphasis on its growth is given mainly to single-brand restaurants, as well as restaurants in less conventional locations. In November 2024, the chain announced its entrance to the Milwaukee and Madison markets in Wisconsin.
Betsy Schmandt took over the role of A&W's CEO and president from Kevin Bazner on March 4, 2025; Bazner continues as a chairman. In April, an agreement was signed to open three restaurants in the Memphis metropolitan area, with the first of the three locations, the one in Millington, scheduled to open by the end of 2025.


== Operations ==
A&W is the only major fast-food chain in the United States to be owned entirely by franchisees since the 2011 sale from Yum! Brands to A Great American Brand, LLC., which is mostly under the control of the National A&W Franchisee Association (NAWFA). The current owners rely heavily on single-brand restaurants, in contrast to combined, co-branded restaurants, which came from prior administrations. As of December 2021, there were 900 restaurants in the US and Asia. In the United States alone, the states with the most restaurants are California, followed by Wisconsin and Michigan. As of year-end 2023, A&W has 455 franchised restaurants in the US market alone. The number of co-branded locations has been on the decline with 243 such units. As of January 2025, A&W has made it to the Franchise 500 list for six consecutive years, standing at 210th place in the 2024 ranking. being in 210th place in the 2024 ranking. The number of restaurants in the United States and in Asia is almost equiparable, with the chain steadily decreasing its number of units in the United States and increasing elsewhere, a trend that has been following since 2015.


== Advertising ==
A&W doesn't do national advertising; the primary factor for such being the lack of restaurants in certain parts of the United States. Its first attempt at doing a national television commercial was on June 16, 1969, when it booked for a slot on NBC's Monday Night at the Movies to advertise take-home gallons of root beer.
In 1976, A&W Restaurants participated in the Easter Seals Telethon, where money from large root beer mugs was collected by the local restaurant on behalf of the TV station broadcasting the telethon in the area.
In 1997, the chain adopted All American Food as its slogan in order to achieve widespread brand recognition. The chain increased its marketing budget in February 2000, eyeing for a new line of burgers in January 2001.
For the summer of 2007, the chain launched the Moove to American campaign, which was created to counter competing chains relying exclusively on foreign beef; the campaign started on June 28 with a stunt featuring 35 cows sent on a barge to the Statue of Liberty. The aim was to petition the National Cattlemen's Beef Association to support consumption of U.S. beef. There was also a campaign to set up a new custom burger, with the winner heading over to Louisville to work for its serving in restaurants.
A grassroots partnership with Green Bay Packers receiver Greg Jennings began in 2009, where Papa Burgers were sold at a price of 85 cents in Green Bay restaurants if Jennings made a touchdown. Due to its success, the campaign expanded to include all of Wisconsin in 2010. Jennings was also appointed as a pitchman for Wisconsin even outside the specialized burger promotion, in a contract signed on October 1, 2009; in exchange, A&W donated $10,000 to The Greg Jennings Foundation.
In January 2013, A&W Restaurants appointed Lexington-based advertising agency Cornett Integrated Marketing as its new agency of record. The contract was renewed in January 2024.
In January 2019, ahead of its hundredth anniversary, A&W removed the ampersand from its logo as part of a tongue-in-cheek campaign to bring back the ampersand to the alphabet as its 27th letter.


=== Collectors' Mug and free floats ===
The first time A&W Restaurants offered a day of free root beer floats was in 2004; under the old management, it was held on June 20, the date of A&W's anniversary, though it is unknown if it donated the proceeds, unlike the current administration. Mid-year, A&W announces the following year's Collectors' Mug, which has a single design for each year. In 2005, it had a full-color image of The Great Root Bear printed on it. By 2010, the event had changed to August 6. It was the chain's first attempt at a digital promotion, where users who liked its Facebook page would receive a digital coupon to redeem a free float.
A&W supports Disabled American Veterans and, since 2013, collects funds for it on National Root Beer Float Day, which is observed on August 6. Donation figures for 2019 were of a record $175,000. In the 2000s it was held in June and was known as National Float Day. Beginning in October 2020, in order to recoup economic losses from the closure of several of its restaurants, A&W set up a series of quizzes on its website. For Halloween that year, it released a web stunt called The Onion Ring, a parody of The Ring.
A&W unveiled a new campaign in 2024, capitalizing on the ampersand of its logo and the tagline Burgers, Floats & Then Some. Packaging was also changed accordingly.


== Mascots ==

In the 1960s, a character named Chubby Chicken appeared on all Chubby burgers.
In 1963, A&W introduced four choices of hamburgers and their corresponding Burger Family members: Papa Burger, Mama Burger, Teen Burger, and Baby Burger. Each burger had a wrapper featuring a cartoon image of the corresponding character.
The chain in the United States also used Dennis the Menace as a bespoke mascot in the 1960s, with special comics for the restaurants appearing mainly in print advertising.

Rooty, the Great American Root Bear, originated as a prototype mascot in kids' meals in the US, but it was in Canada in 1974 that it gained further recognition, as a counter to the Ronald McDonald character of McDonald's and first appeared in the United States and in Asia shortly afterwards. However, the character's introduction was almost aborted when marketing received focus group research results that reported a poor reaction to him . In reaction, the marketing director, acting on instinct about the appeal of the character, ordered the researcher to return to Toronto with the cover story that he never presented the report. The researcher complied, and Rooty was presented to the franchisees as is. Rooty proved a popular marketing success. Rooty's adoption implied the phasing out of the Burger Family and the renaming of almost all of the burgers in the line outside of Canada.
Throughout the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, Rooty was the face of A&W, both the bottled drinks and the restaurant chain, on television and print advertising. His presence all but disappeared in the late 1990s, but in 2011, under A Great American Brand's ownership, Rooty came out of retirement. He has since been featured in print ads, on A&W's website, as the voice of their official Twitter account, and in a variety of YouTube and Vine videos. A bronze statue of the bear was erected at the lobby of the current headquarters. In 2013, Rooty became the first mascot to have an official LinkedIn profile, which was quickly shut down as Rooty was not considered "real" by the authorities at Linkedin.
The mascot made national headlines on January 24, 2023, when a parody tweet referencing the M&M's controversy was posted to its social media profiles, showing Rooty wearing pants, claiming that the mascot's lack of pants was "polarizing". Outrage started emerging from conservative sectors, including Fox News (the report also aired on sister network Fox Business), claiming it to be real. In a follow-up tweet, A&W said that the announcement was a joke. Spokesperson Liz Bazner said that the initial post was "purely in jest" and that A&W has no plans to change Rooty's outfit.
In March 1998, the characters from the comic strip "Blondie," including Blondie and Dagwood Bumstead, were licensed for use at A&W franchises as part of an "All American Food" campaign. A tie-in burger was scheduled for July that year.

=== A&W Root Beer ===
A&W Root Beer is an American brand of root beer that was founded in 1919 by Roy W. Allen and primarily available in the United States and Canada. Allen partnered with Frank Wright in 1922, creating the A&W brand and inspiring a chain of A&W Restaurants founded that year. Originally, A&W Root Beer sold for five cents (equivalent to $0.91 in 2024).
The rights to the A&W brand (except in Canada) are owned by Keurig Dr Pepper, which in turn licenses the brand to the U.S.-based A&W Restaurant chain. A&W Root Beer products are distributed via various U.S. bottlers. A&W Food Services of Canada, which is independent of both Keurig Dr Pepper and the U.S. restaurant chain, is responsible for the restaurants and marketing of root beer products in Canada, with retail products bottled and distributed by the Coca-Cola Company. The U.S. variant is also sold as an import drink in Southeast Asia and Italy (where A&W has restaurants), as well as in Australia, Chile, and other countries.


== History ==
Roy W. Allen opened a roadside root beer stand in Lodi, California in 1919, using a formula that he had purchased from a pharmacist. He soon opened stands in Stockton, as well as five stands in nearby Sacramento - where "tray boys" pioneered drive-in curbside service. In 1920 Allen partnered with Frank Wright, birthing the A&W brand name.
Allen bought Wright out, obtained a trademark, and began selling restaurant franchises - creating one of the first restaurant chains in the United States. Franchise owners could use the A&W name and logo and purchased concentrated root beer syrup from Allen. There was no common menu, architecture, or set of procedures, and some chose to also sell food. By 1933 there were 170 A&W franchises.
Franchises struggled with labor shortages and sugar rationing during World War II, but following the war GI loans helped, in part, the number of A&W outlets to triple. The proliferation of the automobile and the mobility it offered resulted in more than 450 A&W Root Beer stands operating by 1950. That year Allen retired and sold the business to Nebraskan Gene Hurtz, who formed the A&W Root Beer Company. The first A&W Root Beer outlet in Canada opened in 1956.
By 1960 the number of A&W restaurants swelled to more than 2,000.
In 1963 the company was sold to the J. Hungerford Smith Company, which had produced Allen's concentrate since 1921. That year the first overseas A&W restaurant opened its doors in Guam. In 1966 Hungerford was sold to the United Fruit Company, which merged with AMK Corporation in 1970 to form the United Brands Company.
In 1971 United Brands formed a wholly owned subsidiary, A&W Distributing Co., to retail its root beer. After test runs in Arizona and California the products were distributed nationally, including sugar-free, low-sodium, and caffeine-free versions. In 1974, A&W introduced "The Great Root Bear", a mascot that served as a goodwill ambassador for the brand.
In the late 1970s A&W Restaurants was formed to manage restaurant franchising. It was bought in 1982 by A. Alfred Taubman.
The bear and its associated jingle became the basis of a long-running Canadian advertising campaign. The mascot was so successful that it was eventually adopted by the American A&W chain as well.
In 1983, United Brands sold A&W Root Beer to a group of investors, led by Castle & Cooke. In 1984, it had an advertising budget of $10 million. In 1986, Hicks & Haas and management bought A&W from the investor group.
In 1986 A&W Cream Soda and A&W Diet Cream Soda were introduced and distributed nationally, followed in 1987 by the reformulation of A&W Sugar-Free as Diet A&W. Also in 1986, A&W acquired Squirt. The company went public in 1987 and also acquired Vernors. 
In October 1993 A&W Beverages was folded into Cadbury Beverages. It spun off its U.S. beverages business as Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2008.
In July 2017 A&W Canada reformulated its root beer, dropping high fructose corn syrup and some flavors from the recipe, substituting cane sugar, sarsaparilla root, licorice, birch bark and anise. A&W Canada launched the new formula by declaring Free Root Beer Day, serving free root beer at all locations on July 22, 2017.
In November 2020 Diet A&W was rebranded as A&W Zero Sugar.


== Brands ==
A&W Sugar-Free was introduced in 1974 and reformulated as Diet A&W in 1987. In 2020, it was rebranded again under the name A&W Zero Sugar.
A&W Cream Soda and A&W Diet Cream Soda were introduced in 1986.
A&W Floats and Sunkist Floats were introduced in 2008.
A&W TEN, a low-calorie root beer, began appearing in American supermarkets in the spring of 2013.

Through eBay, A&W and Jim Belushi offered a trip to Los Angeles with a VIP pass to the "A&W Ultimate All-American Cookout and Concert" at the House of Blues.
In celebration of its 100th anniversary, A&W offered a free two-liter bottle of its root beer in exchange for taking the Family Fun Pledge, which asked participants to be "technology-free for one hour every Friday night this summer."


== The Great Root Bear ==

The Great Root Bear, also called Rooty, became the mascot for A&W Root Beer in 1973.
In a long-running television advertising campaign for the Canadian A&W chain, his theme was a tuba-driven jingle entitled "Ba-Dum, Ba-Dum". The jingle was released as a single by Attic Records in Canada. It was credited to "Major Ursus", a play on the constellation name Ursa Major, which means "great bear". The famous Canadian composer and B.C. Hall of Fame enshrinee Robert Buckley helped compose the song.
In late 2011, the new ownership of A&W began using the mascot again, particularly in A&W's online presence.


== A&W Restaurants ==

Shortly after Allen bought out Wright's portion of the business he began franchising the product. His profits came from a small franchise fee and sales of concentrate. There was no standard food menu for franchises until 1978. By 1960 the company had 2,000 stores.
In 1989 A&W made an agreement with Minnesota-based chain Carousel Snack Bars to convert that chain's 200 locations (mostly kiosks in shopping malls) to "A&W Hot Dogs & More". Some A&W Hot Dogs & More locations are in operation today.
Many A&W locations that opened in the U.S. during the Yum! Brands ownership years (2002–2011) were co-branded with Yum!'s other chains—Long John Silver's, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut or KFC.
As of December 2011 A&W was under new ownership and its world headquarters was moved back to Lexington, Kentucky. Since then, in the United States and Southeast Asia, A&W has been owned by a group of franchisees (as A Great American Brand).

=== A'Lelia Walker ===
A'Lelia Walker (born Lelia McWilliams; June 6, 1885 – August 17, 1931) was an American businesswoman and patron of the arts. She was the only surviving child of Madam C. J. Walker, who was popularly credited as being the first self-made female millionaire in the United States and one of the first African-American millionaires.


== Life and career ==


=== Early life ===
A'Lelia Walker was born Lelia McWilliams in Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1885, the daughter of Moses and Sarah (née Breedlove) McWilliams. Her father died when she was two years old, and she moved with her mother to St. Louis, Missouri to live with her mother's three brothers. Her mother married John Davis in 1894 and divorced in 1903. In 1906, her mother married Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaper advertising salesman, and became an independent hairdresser and cosmetic cream retailer. A'Lelia grew up in St. Louis and attended Knoxville College in Tennessee before entering the family business, having taken the Walker name.


=== Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company ===
A'Lelia Walker ran the East Coast operations of her mother's company. Her mother purchased two brownstones in New York City at 108-110 West 136th Street near Lenox Avenue in Harlem, and combined them. The first floor housed the Walker Hair Parlor, and the second the Lelia College of Beauty Culture, where new cosmeticians were trained to work in the company's shops. A'Lelia lived and entertained in the top three floors. She became president of the company in 1919, upon her mother's death, and remained in that position until she died in August 1931. She initiated several marketing campaigns to promote the company—including a competition among prominent ministers for a Trip to the Holy Land in 1924—and remained the face of the Walker Company. Still, day-to-day operations were overseen by attorney F. B. Ransom and factory manager Alice Kelly at the Indianapolis headquarters. During the 1920s, A'Lelia Walker immersed herself in Harlem's dynamic social life as a patron of the arts and hostess of some of the era's most notable social gatherings.
Walker Company sales began to suffer in 1929, with the beginning of the Great Depression. A new million-dollar headquarters and manufacturing facility, opened in late 1927 in Indianapolis, placed additional expenses and financial pressure on the operation, and she sold a great deal of valuable art and antiques. Her adopted daughter Mae Walker became company president from 1931 until she died in 1945. In a fourth-generation succession, Mae's daughter A'Lelia Mae Perry Bundles (b. 1928– d. 1976) succeeded her mother as the head of the company. Today, the company's building is known as the Madame Walker Theatre Center and is a National Historic Landmark.


=== Patronage ===
A'Lelia Walker counted among her friends many accomplished African American musicians. She developed an early love of classical music and opera in part because the choir director at the AME church she and her mother attended in St. Louis was a classically trained opera singer and organist. She grew up in the neighborhood where Scott Joplin and other ragtime musicians gathered at Tom Turpin's Rosebud Cafe on St. Louis's Market Street.

During the 1920s, she hosted many musicians, actors, writers, artists, political figures, and socialites in her Manhattan townhouse. The elegant brick and limestone building had been designed by Vertner Tandy, a founder of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and the first black architect licensed in New York State. Almost from the time of her arrival in Harlem in 1913, her dinner parties, dances, and soirées included well-known Harlem figures like James Reese Europe, J. Rosamond Johnson, Bert Williams and Florence Mills, as well as members of the Harlem Renaissance such as Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, and Carl Van Vechten. Live music – from classical and ragtime to jazz and blues – was a regular feature with entertainment provided by her musician friends. According to NPR: They provided a safe, welcoming environment for queer people at a time when there were few other social options available. While she herself was not known to be lesbian or bisexual, Walker's parties were places where anyone could express their sexuality however they pleased. In an oral history for the Lesbian Herstory Archives Mabel Hampton, the lesbian activist, described attending a party at Walker's home where she said some party-goers were naked and openly having sex. 
In October 1927, she converted a home floor into The Dark Tower, a cultural salon that became legendary as one of the gathering places of the era. Harlem's talented artists socialized with their Greenwich Village counterparts and European and African royalty in this place. She commissioned Austrian designer Paul Frankl to create the interior. She also entertained at her pied-à-terre at 80 Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem and Villa Lewaro, her country house in Irvington, New York in Westchester County – a 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) Italianate mansion which she had built for her mother in 1916 to 1918, again designed by Tandy. Villa Lewaro was named for Walker (Lelia Walker Robinson) after Italian tenor Enrico Caruso told her after a visit to the property that the newly built Irvington-on-Hudson mansion reminded him of the houses of his native country.
Walker also founded the Harlem Debutantes Club. She attended Knoxville College and was a member of St. James Presbyterian Church in Harlem, where she married Dr. Wiley Wilson. She supported local missionary work among Baptist women in New York City. She attended a Baptist church and served on various committees, occasionally speaking for women's days and professional events.


== Personal life ==
Walker was married three times: to John Robinson, a hotel waiter, from whom she separated about 1911 and divorced in 1914; to Dr. Wiley Wilson in 1919; and to Dr. James Arthur Kennedy, in 1926, whom she divorced just a few months before she died in 1931.
In the 1920s, Walker spent four months traveling throughout Europe and elsewhere, visiting Paris, Nice, Monte Carlo, Naples, Rome, Cairo, Jerusalem, Djibouti, Addis Ababa, and London. In Paris she spent time with dancer Josephine Baker, couturier Paul Poiret, actress Mistinguett, and actor Dooley Wilson. She also visited Zewditu, the Empress of Ethiopia while on her way to Addis Ababa.
Her adoptive daughter, Fairy Mae Bryant, was born in November 1898 and was adopted in 1912. She was known as "Mae Walker" and traveled with Madam C. J. Walker as a model and assistant. In November 1923, A'Lelia Walker orchestrated an elaborate "Million Dollar Wedding" (closer to $40,000) for Mae's marriage to Dr. Gordon Jackson. Mae, a graduate of Spelman Seminary in Atlanta, divorced Jackson in 1926 and married Attorney Marion R. Perry in September 1927. When Walker died in 1931, Mae took over the company until she died in 1945, when she was succeeded by her daughter, A'Lelia Mae Perry Bundles.


== Death and legacy ==
A'Lelia Walker died on August 17, 1931, of a cerebral hemorrhage brought on by hypertension, the same ailment that led to her mother's death in 1919. She was surrounded by friends who had traveled to Long Branch, New Jersey to celebrate a birthday party with lobster and champagne amid the Great Depression and Prohibition. Thousands of Harlemites lined up to view her body. She was eulogized by Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Sr. at the funeral parlor on Seventh Avenue. Mary McLeod Bethune, the civil rights activist, also spoke at the funeral. As her casket was lowered into the ground next to her mother's grave at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, Hubert Julian —the celebrated "Black Eagle"— flew over in a small plane and dropped dahlias and gladioli onto the site.
Langston Hughes called her death "The end of the gay times of the New Negro era in Harlem." He later wrote in his book, The Big Sea, that, fittingly, the funeral resembled a big party, "with hundreds of friends outside, waving their white, engraved invitations aloft in the vain hope of entering."
Sterling Houston and Lary Neal wrote A'Lelia, a musical about Walker.
Actress Tiffany Haddish portrayed Walker in the Netflix miniseries Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C. J. Walker which premiered on March 20, 2020.

=== A'Shawn Robinson ===
A'Shawn Robinson (born March 21, 1995) is an American professional football defensive end for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide. He was selected by the Detroit Lions in the second round of the 2016 NFL draft and has also played in the NFL for the Los Angeles Rams, with whom he won Super Bowl LVI.
Robinson was a five-star recruit out of high school, with one service listing him as the nation's top defensive tackle. Robinson played in all 13 of Alabama's games in the 2013 season and started in two games. Robinson was the only true freshman under head coach Nick Saban at Alabama to lead the team in sacks. At 320 pounds, Robinson would line-up at both defensive end and tackle for Alabama during his freshman season. In his junior season, he appeared at fullback in goal line situations in games against LSU and Michigan State in addition to starting on the defensive line.


== Early life ==
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Robinson attended Arlington Heights High School. In addition to football, he competed on his high school's varsity basketball and track & field teams. A two-way lineman for the Arlington Heights Yellowjackets football team, Robinson was coached by Todd Whitten in his senior season. After the season, Robinson played for the West squad in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, and was selected to the 2012 USA Today All-American Second-team.
Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Robinson was listed as the No. 4 defensive tackle in the nation in 2013. ESPN listed him as a four-star recruit and ranked him 105th overall on their "ESPN 300" ranking. Robinson chose to attend Alabama over Texas, Southern California, Louisiana State, Arkansas, and Florida State. He was originally verbally committed to attend Texas as of February 2012. Just prior to National Signing Day in February 2013, however, he de-committed from Texas and officially signed with Alabama.


== College career ==


=== Freshman year (2013) ===
Robinson started practicing with Alabama in August 2013 and played in the first game of Alabama's 2013 season on August 31, 2013. Robinson and tight end O. J. Howard were Alabama's only true freshmen to have both started a game and played in every game of the 2013 season. Robinson was also the only true freshman under head coach Nick Saban at Alabama to lead the team in sacks.
Robinson led Alabama in sacks and was seventh on the team in tackles. He was named by Alabama's coaches as one of the defensive "players of the week" in three of Alabama's 12 games. No other true freshman was a "player of the week" on offense or defense during the 2013 season. At Alabama's annual awards banquet after the 2013 regular season Robinson was one of four players to receive an "Iron Man Award" given to players who have shown the most dedication to the individual and team goals of the Crimson Tide's year-round strength and conditioning program.
At the end of his first college football season Robinson was the only Alabama freshman named to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Coaches' All-Freshman team. Robinson was also on the 2013 Sporting News Freshman All-American team.


=== Sophomore year (2014) ===
Robinson was selected to the 2014 first-team in the pre-season Media Days All-SEC Team. He was held out of some practices in August due to a sprained knee. He led his team in tackles in the 2014 SEC Championship game versus Missouri. It was the first time in his career that he led the team in tackles. He started every game in the 2014 season, during which Alabama led the nation in rushing defense. His teammates gave him the nickname of "Infamous A-Tron," a blend of A'Shawn and Megatron. Robinson earned Honorable Mention on the All-SEC team after the 2014 season.


=== Junior year (2015) ===
Robinson started every game for the second season in a row and anchored a deep defensive line that helped Alabama lead college football in rushing yards allowed per game, yards per carry allowed per game, and sacks. Robinson led Alabama in quarterback hurries and was a finalist for the Outland Trophy, an award for the nation's best interior lineman (both offensive and defensive). Robinson did not win the Outland Trophy, and the Alabama football team used this snub as motivation in their College Football Playoff game against Michigan State. After the season, Robinson decided to forgo his senior year and enter the 2016 NFL draft.


== Professional career ==


=== Detroit Lions ===

Robinson was selected in the second round with the 46th overall pick by the Detroit Lions in the 2016 NFL Draft. On May 10, 2016, Robinson signed with the Detroit Lions. He recorded his first career sack against Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz in Week 5. In Week 16 of the 2016 season, against the Dallas Cowboys, Robinson drew an unnecessary roughness penalty for tackling running back Ezekiel Elliott too hard. The motion Robinson used on the tackle made it look like he was picking up Elliot and slamming him down, but the announcers agreed that the hit looked clean. He finished his rookie season leading all defensive tackles in the NFL in pass deflections with seven.
During Week 6 of the 2017 NFL season, Robinson recorded his first career interception off Drew Brees and returned it two yards for a touchdown. However, the Lions still lost to the New Orleans Saints by a score of 52–38. In Week 9, he blocked a Mason Crosby field goal to help the Lions beat the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field by a score of 30–17.
In the 2018 season, Robinson played in 13 games with seven starts, recording 49 tackles, one sack, and one forced fumble. He was placed on injured reserve on December 28, 2018.
In the 2019 season, Robinson played in 13 games with nine starts, recording 40 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and one forced fumble.


=== Los Angeles Rams ===
On April 24, 2020, the Los Angeles Rams signed Robinson to a two-year contract. He was placed on the active/non-football injury list at the start of training camp on August 8, 2020. He was placed on reserve/non-football injury to start the season. He was activated on October 30, 2020. He appeared in eight games in the 2020 season.
In the 2021 season, Robinson recorded two sacks, 67 total tackles, and two forced fumbles in 17 games. Robinson helped the Rams win Super Bowl LVI by defeating the Cincinnati Bengals 23–20. In the Super Bowl, Robinson recorded six tackles and one sack and was instrumental in shutting down the Bengals running game.
On November 26, 2022, Robinson was placed on injured reserve with a torn meniscus. He finished the 2022 season with 42 total tackles in ten games.


=== New York Giants ===

== Personal life ==
Due to his physical appearance, Robinson is often questioned of his actual age.  Having started playing football at the age of 4, his mother stated that she would bring his birth certificate to games, due to opposing coaches challenging his age for eligibility. "I couldn't play because I was too big and they had to see my birth certificate," said Robinson.  This would continue into his adult years; he shared that he was often mistaken for a 35-year-old coach when he was actually a 20-year-old student athlete.

=== A' Bhuidheanach Bheag ===
A' Bhuidheanach Bheag is a Scottish mountain situated on the eastern side of the Pass of Drumochter, some 24 km WNW of Blair Atholl. The mountain straddles the border between Highland and Perth and Kinross council areas although the actual summit is in the latter.


== Overview ==
The high ground to the east side of the Pass of Drumochter takes the form of a huge undulating plateau, with an average height of over 800 metres, which stretches NE for 13 km to Loch an t-Seilich in the Gaick Forest. This area is often dismissed as uninteresting countryside, however it does contain two Munros which draws many walkers to the locale. A' Bhuidheanach Bheag lies to the southern end of the plateau and when viewed from the A9 road it shows many shallow ravines and gullies. The actual summit is out of sight from the A9 being sited back from the edge of the plateau. The rolling nature of the terrain makes A' Bhuidheanach Bheag a good hill for ski mountaineering.
Despite its understated reputation A' Bhuidheanach Bheag does offer the walker the feeling of space and the wide open skies of the high Grampian mountains. Its gentle curving slopes have much wildlife with Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, grouse and mountain hare seen on a regular basis. The hill's name translates from the Gaelic language as “Little Yellow Place” and is thought to refer to the coarse yellow grass which grows on its slopes. The “Little” part of the name is slightly confusing as the hill is the highest point on the southern part of the plateau but demonstrates that the hill was named from how it looked from the valley not by its altitude.


== Geography and geology ==
A' Bhuidheanach Bheag's best geographical feature is the remote Cama Choire on the eastern side of the mountain. This is a steep sided valley which cuts deeply into the hill and is drained by the Allt a’ Chama Choire. The coire is well seen from the hill of An Dun above the Gaick Pass. From a geological point of view the most interesting characteristic of the mountain is Coire Mhic-sith on its south-western flank. The coire is a deeply incised, fault-guided valley which has received the attention of geologists, especially the School of Geoscience at the University of Edinburgh who have concluded that the presence of glacial silt and sand in the valley along with a glacial spillway to the adjacent valley of the Edendon Water means that the coire had a large ice dammed lake during the last Ice age. This Proglacial lake drained away when the ice melted but has left evidence similar, but on a lesser scale, to the “parallel roads” in Glen Roy.
The summit of the mountain is a gentle rise on the plateau and is only made obvious by the presence of an OS trig point. There are occasional quartzite outcrops across the summit plateau and some of the boulders have been collected to surround the trig point, a few iron fence post have also been included. The OS map also shows a 936-metre spot height, half a kilometre to the west of the recognised summit. The summit is crossed by  a line of old rusting boundary fence posts and these lead unerringly to the adjoining Munro of Càrn na Caim which lies five km to the north across a boggy col with a height of 825 metres.
A'Bhuidheanach Bheag has two subsidiary tops over 3,000 feet in height.  Glas Mheall Mòr (928 metres), just over two km to the ESE, is a Top in the current edition of Munro's Tables.  Meall a' Chaorainn (916 metres) is located 1.5 km to the west of the summit and was deleted from the tables in 1981. All drainage from the mountain finds its way to the east coast of Scotland, the majority goes south to join the River Tay while a smaller percentage goes north via Glen Truim to join the River Spey.


== Ascents ==
A' Bhuidheanach Bheag is usually climbed from the A9 road, there are two possible starting points, Balsporan Cottages (NN627791) or 1.5 km to the north at the foot of Coire Chuirn. A more interesting route starts from the secluded country to the east at the ruined Sronphadruig Lodge and ascends by the Cama Choire to reach the plateau. Many walkers will continue to the adjacent Munro of Càrn na Caim, the plateau is quite featureless and a map and compass is necessary in misty conditions.

=== A' Chrois ===
A' Chrois is a mountain located in the Arrochar Alps north west of Arrochar in Argyll, an extremely scenic area which is technically in the highlands although it is within easy reach of the heavily populated areas of Glasgow. A' Chrois stands north of Arrochar at the head of Loch Long and reaches a summit elevation of 848 metres (2,782 ft). The mountain forms a ridge starting with Ben Arthur The Cobbler in the south by Ardgartan through Beinn Narnain to A' Chrois in the north by Glen Loin, visible to Loch Lomond. A' Chrois also provides the eastern gateway to the Arrochar Alps and can be climbed via Beinn Narnain or Succoth. It is classed as a Corbett Top of Beinn Narnain.

=== A' Chràlaig ===
A' Chralaig (Scottish Gaelic: A' Chràileag) is a mountain in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland, north of Loch Cluanie and south of Glen Affric. It is a Munro with a height of 1,120 metres (3,670 ft). It is the highest peak along Glen Shiel and can be easily climbed from the Cluanie Inn on the A87. The eastern slopes of the mountain, are owned by the Forestry Commission and are part of the Kintail National Scenic Area.
Despite being the highest peak on the ridge, it is considered less interesting than the route over Stob Coire na Cràlaig to the nearby Mullach Fraoch-choire. These two peaks may be combined with the neighbouring peaks of Sgurr nan Conbhairean and Sail Chaorainn to make the so-called "Cluanie Horseshoe", although no path connects A' Chràlaig with the peaks to the east.

=== A' Chùli ===
A' Chùli is an uninhabited island in the Garvellachs in the Firth of Lorn, in the council area of Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It is 20 ha (49 acres) in extent and lies between Garbh Eileach and Eileach an Naoimh, the two largest islands of the archipelago. Grob nan Sgarbh, Sgeir Leth a' Chuain and Sgeir nam Marag are small skerries offshore to the southwest.

An earlier name of the island was Cùil Bhrianainn meaning "Brendan's retreat" and Brendan the Navigator is reputed to have built a chapel and been buried there. However, no trace of the chapel is visible and a similar fate appears to have befallen two unroofed buildings, thought to be shielings, recorded in 1881 by the Ordnance Survey.
On 7 March 1981 a fishing boat foundered approximately 0.8 km (0.50 mi) northwest of the island.

=== A' Cleachdadh na Gàidhlig ===
A' Cleachdadh na Gàidhlig: slatan-tomhais ann an dìon cànain sa choimhearsnachd is an anthology of essays edited by Richard A.V. Cox and Timothy Currie Armstrong addressing the current state of the Gaelic language and assessing efforts to effect language revitalization in Gaelic-speaking communities in Scotland. Published in 2011, the book was ground-breaking on several counts. It was the first book of its kind to address sociolinguistic and language planning issues surrounding the Gaelic-language revival predominantly written in the Gaelic language itself.  It is also noteworthy and unusual for its breadth of analysis, drawing together academic research articles, articles by policy makers, and articles from activists and language development professionals reporting on specific Gaelic revitalization projects.   Four of the articles address the Welsh language revival and make useful comparisons between initiatives in Wales and the revival in Scotland.

=== A' Ghlas-bheinn ===
A' Ghlas-bhienn (918 m) is a mountain in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. It lies in the Kintail area of Ross-shire, close to the settlement of Morvich.
A rocky peak, its ascent can be done in conjunction with the Falls of Glomach.

=== A' Mhaighdean ===
A' Mhaighdean is one of the least accessible of the munros in northern Scotland. It is 8 miles (13 km) north of Kinlochewe but most easily accessible from Poolewe, taking a private road South East (pedestrian & bicycle access only) to Kernsary. A good track then leads to the causeway between the Fionn Loch and Dubh Loch. Follow the path eastwards to about the 1,000 feet (300 m) level and cross the Allt Bruthach an Esain to gain the North West ridge of the mountain.
The mountain is composed of gneiss, the summit presenting the highest elevation of the Lewisian. Part of the North West ridge is capped by Torridonian sandstone.

=== A' Mharconaich ===
A' Mharconaich (Scottish Gaelic: A' Mharcanaich) is a mountain near Dalwhinnie in the Scottish Highlands. It is a Munro with a height of 975 metres (3,199 ft). It is in a group of mountains east of Loch Ericht and west of the A9 road and Pass of Drumochter, and are known accordingly as the Drumochter Hills. A' Mharconaich is just within the Cairngorms National Park although it is not part of the Cairngorms mountains.


== Overview ==
A' Mharconaich is a Munro of height 975 metres (3199 feet). It is well seen by travellers on the A9 to which it shows it more steeper and rugged eastern flanks with a high corrie located just beneath the summit. The mountain's names translates from Gaelic as "the horse place" and dates from a time when horses were a valuable element of the economy of the region: places where horses gathered would be noted and named accordingly. The hill is crossed by the border between Perth and Kinross and Highland areas or in the old day Perthshire and Inverness-shire and is marked by old rusting fence posts which can be used as an aid to navigation when traversing the hill.


== Geography ==
A' Mharconaich has a SW-NE orientated summit ridge, just over a kilometre long with high points at each end. The NE summit is regarded as the highest point and this has been confirmed by an Abney Level survey which found the SW top, named Bruach nan Iomairean, to be a few metres lower. The 1974 edition of Munro's Tables moved the summit to the SW top, possibly in error, but the location reverted to the original summit in 1981. A' Mharconaich throws out two fine steep ridges on either side of the eastern corrie. The NE ridge descends initially as a steep buttress before easing and continuing for three km to reach the A9 at Balsporran Cottages.
The less well defined eastern ridge descends steeply from Bruach nan Iomairean to a col with a height of approximately 655 metres which links to the hill the Boar of Badenoch also known as An Torc. The line of old fence posts can be followed the whole way. The Boar reaches a height of 739 metres and is a Graham Top. It is a fine viewpoint down into the Pass of Drumochter.
To the SW A' Mharconaich links to the adjacent Munro of Beinn Udlamain, again following the fence posts for four km across undulating ground with little loss of height. This area is often teeming with deer being part of the Dalnaspidal deer forest. 2.5 km to the north is another Munro, Geal-chàrn which is reached by descending to a height of 739 metres and traversing around the head of Coire Fhar. Drainage from A' Mharconaich  reaches the east coast of Scotland but is divided by the Pass of Drumochter, either going north to join the River Spey or south to meet the River Tay.


== Ascents and view ==
There are two starting points for the direct ascent of A' Mharconaich and several permutations if it is being climbed in conjunction with other hills as it usually is. One route starts on the A9 at the top of the Pass of Drumochter at grid reference NN632755 and goes up Coire Dhomhain for just over a kilometre and then ascending NW to the col between A' Mharconaich and the Boar of Badenoch from where the line of fence posts is followed steeply to the summit ridge. This starting point can be used for a complete circuit of Coire Dhomhain taking in the other two Munros of Sgairneach Mhòr and Beinn Udlamain.
An alternative start is at Balsporran cottages (NN627791), and offers a direct ascent up the NE ridge or a longer walk which takes in the adjoining Munro of Geal-chàrn. The summit is marked by a substantial collection of stones which has been shaped in to a wind shelter rather than the usual cairn. The view includes Loch Ericht and Loch Pattack to the NW and the Ben Alder massif.

=== A' Mhòine ===
A' Mhòine (Scottish Gaelic: [ә.ˈvɔːɲә]), variously anglicised as the Moine, the Moin, or the Mhoine, is a peninsula in the north of Sutherland in the Highlands, Scotland. The peninsula is bounded to the west by Loch Eriboll, and to the east by the Kyle of Tongue. The A838 road crosses the peninsula on an east–west axis. The coastline includes cliffs, waterfalls, and a few sandy beaches.
Much of the peninsula is owned by Melness Estate on behalf of 59 crofters. Most of the population live in Melness, which is made up of several crofting townships and hamlets including Talmine and Midfield.
The name is from the Scottish Gaelic mhòine or mòine meaning "moss" or "peat". The Moinian geological group and the Moine Thrust Belt were in turn named after the peninsula.


== Conservation areas ==
The peninsula contains large areas of blanket bog, forming part of the Flow Country. Eriboll East and Whiten Head, at the western and northern sides of the peninsula, are designated as part of a special landscape area, and two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) cover a large proportion of the peninsula. One of these includes Ben Hutig and a section of the northern cliffs, and is of interest for its blanket bog, Alpine heath plants,and geology. The other covers a further 5,964 hectares (14,740 acres) of blanket bog and the birds that breed there.
A'Mhòine sits within both a Special Protection Area and a Special Area of Conservation titled the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands, and is home to golden eagles, greylag geese, dunlin and other wading birds, as well as "rare water-dependent plants, dwarf shrubs and alpine heath".


== Ben Hutig ==
The 408 m (1,339 ft) peak of Ben Hutig rises on the peninsula, with a  ridge descending towards the northern cliffs. Sitting at the northern end of the Moine Thrust Belt, the hill has numerous rocky outcrops that exemplify that belt's geology, and more examples can be seen in the nearby cliffs.
Around the peak are the remains of a "Colby camp", named after 19th century surveyor Thomas Frederick Colby, who visited the hill in 1838 as part of the Trigonometrical Survey of Scotland. Ben Hutig is one of the last hills he surveyed. The camp comprises several dry stone walls and, unusually, a set of steps leading into an enclosure on the summit. That enclosure now contains a more recent triangulation station.


== Crossing routes ==
There are two established routes across the peninsula. The A838 crosses the centre of the peninsula from Tongue to Hope. It largely follows a route commissioned by the Duke of Sutherland in 1830, and passes the ruins of Moine House, a small building "erected for the refuge of the traveller". It is now part of the North Coast 500 touring route, and deviates slightly from the Duke of Sutherland's road in places following upgrades in the late 20th century.
To the south of the peninsula, a wide track known as the Moine path runs for 18.5 km (11.5 miles) between Strathmore Hope Road and Kinloch Lodge, where it joins the road around the Kyle of Tongue. The path runs around the northern end of Ben Hope and is popular with walkers. Its origins are unclear but it is thought to have been a drovers' road.


== Sutherland spaceport project ==

In 2018, the peninsula was selected by Highlands and Islands Enterprise as the site for Sutherland spaceport, which would be the United Kingdom's first spaceport.
Permission to build the spaceport was opposed by a holding objection from the Wildland company of billionaire Danish couple Anne and Anders Povlson, who argued that the area is protected under the Ramsar Convention, a 1971 treaty covering internationally important wetlands, ratified by the UK in 1976. The Melness Estate is in favour of the project, however, as rent from the spaceport and profit-sharing could help fund efforts to regenerate the peat bog and invest in the local community. 
In June 2020, The Highland Council provided planning permission for the £17 million project, allowing 12 launches a year. Ground was broken for the build on 5 May 2023.

=== A'a Village Site ===
The A'a Village Site, designated "AS-34-33" by archaeologists, is an abandoned village site on the island of Tutuila in American Samoa.  Located on a bay (nearly inaccessible by land) on the northwest coast of the island, the site was first surveyed by professional archaeologists in 1985.  The site has four distinct areas, in which features interpreted as house foundations have been located, as have rock walls, grave sites, and platform mounds.  The site was not known to be occupied within the living memory of nearby residents, and the size of trees in the site suggests it has been abandoned since the 1860s.
The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

=== A'akuluujjusi ===
In Inuit religion, A'akuluujjusi is considered the great creator mother, a primordial goddess.


== Creation myth ==
A'akuluujjusi created animals from her clothes. First, she set her trousers on the ground, creating caribou, and gave them tusks. When she threw her jacket down, it turned into a walrus; she placed antlers on its head. The animals kept attacking people who tried to hunt them, so she made some revisions, swapping horns and tusks. She found the walrus was perfect with tusks. Yet, the caribou was running too fast to be caught by hunters. Therefore, she turned his belly hair against the wind to slow him down.

=== A'ala Hubail ===
A'ala Ahmed Mohamed Hubail (Arabic: علاء أحمد محمد حبيل; born 25 June 1982) is a Bahraini former professional footballer who played as a striker. With the Bahrain national team.


== 2011 detention ==

On 5 April 2011 A'ala Hubail and his brother Mohamed (also a member of the national football team) were arrested by the Bahraini authorities and held in custody on an indefinite basis. A'ala Hubail, a trained paramedic, had attended demonstrations during the 2011 Bahraini protests and had reportedly helped provide medical assistance. The day before his arrest A'ala Hubail had appeared on a chatshow programme on Bahrain state television in which he had been aggressively questioned and criticised. Al-Ahli announced that the brothers had been dismissed from the club squad.
It was reported that he had received treatment in a military hospital after being tortured and that he may have suffered an injury to one of his feet.
On 23 June it was announced that Mohamed Hubail had been secretly tried and sentenced to two years in prison by the Bahraini special security court established under the martial law regime imposed in March 2011. A'ala Hubail's trial was reported to have begun in secret on 24 June 2011.
On 24 June FIFA, the world football governing body, announced that it had asked the Bahraini football authorities to provide information about cases of players detained during political protests. Following allegations of government interference in the sport after Mohammed Hubail's prison sentence and A'ala Hubail's trial and the suspension of over 150 athletes, coaches and referees for taking part in anti-government protests, Bahrain could face a ban from world soccer. Suspension by FIFA could prevent Bahrain participating in Asian Olympic Games qualifying round matches (due in September 2011). According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, the Bahraini trials appeared to bear the marks of political persecution and there were serious concerns that the due process rights of the defendants were not respected.
On 29 June 2011 the Bahrain News Agency reported that the Bahrain Defence Force military public prosecutor had announced that "defendants involved at medical and sport crimes" had been released, but trials would continue in accordance with Bahraini legal procedures.

=== A'ali ===
A'ali (Arabic: عالي) is a major town in northern Bahrain. It is a part of the Northern Governorate, although from 2001 to 2014 it lay within the Central Governorate. A'ali is famous for its ancient burial mounds, especially several very large burial mounds in the city centre. A'ali is also famous for its traditional handcrafted pottery, which can be seen and bought from different potters and boutiques in the whole town.


== History ==


=== Dilmun era ===

The burial mounds date to the Dilmun era (3200 BC-330 BC). In February 1889 some of the mounds were investigated by the British explorer J. Theodore Bent and his wife Mabel. The site was then excavated by many foreign archaeological teams throughout the 20th century. An important group of artifacts was excavated by the British archaeologist Ernest Mackay and can now be found in the British Museum, London. It includes an unusual statuette of a nude woman with a curvaceous body dating from between 2000 and 1500 BC.   The discovery of a "new and rare type of burial mound encircled by an outer ring wall" has led archaeologists to believe that specific mounds were made for the social elite, indicating that early Dilmun culture had a class system.


=== 20th century ===
According to J. G. Lorimer's 1908 Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, A'ali was a considerable village situated 6 miles southwest of the Manama fort. The town consisted of 200 houses populated by the Baharna, who were primarily pottery-makers and date palm cultivators. There were an estimated 8,250 date palms in the village and livestock included 35 donkeys & 10 cattle. Lorimer also mentions that the village was the site of the largest tumuli on the island


== Geography ==
A'ali is located in the middle of Bahrain Island (al-awal island), south of Isa Town and north of Riffa. Its name (Arabic: عالي) translates to “high” in English and refers to the town’s high elevation from sea level. It lays approximately 15 km (9.3 miles) southwest of the capital Manama.


== Controversy ==
The mounds have been a source of controversy in Bahraini politics; in July 2008, the municipal council chairman of the central governorate called for the demolition of 62 ancient burial mounds to make way for the construction of a nearby junction. In 2009, the construction of a museum dedicated to the history of the mounds and of A'ali was announced.

=== A'annepada ===
A'annepada (Sumerian: 𒀀𒀭𒉌𒅆𒊒𒁕, romanized: Aanépàdda; fl. c. 2350 BC) was a king of the First Dynasty of Ur. He was a son of Mesannepada. It is thought that his tomb may be tomb PG 580 in the Royal Cemetery at Ur.


== Votive tablets ==
Several tablets are known that bear his name, in particular dedicated to Ninhursag, and proclaiming Mesannepada as his father:

𒀭𒊩𒌆𒄯𒊕 / 𒀀𒀭𒉌𒅆𒊒𒁕 / 𒈗𒌶𒆠 / 𒌉𒈩𒀭𒉌𒅆𒊒𒁕 / 𒈗𒌶𒆠 /𒀭𒊩𒌆𒉺𒂅𒊏 / 𒂍 𒈬𒈾𒆕
Dnin-hur-sag / a-an-ne2-pa3-da / lugal uri5{ki} / dumu mes-an-ne2-pa3-da / lugal uri5{ki} /Dnin-hur-sag-ra / e2 mu-na-du3

"For Nin-hursag: A'annepada, king of Ur, son of Mesannepada, king of Ur, built the temple for Ninhursag."


== Foundation cone ==

A foundation cone in a copper alloy was found in Ur, bearing the name of "King A'annepada" in a dedication for Inanna, now in the British Museum (BM 90951).
The cone was discovered by John Taylor in 1854 during his excavations in Ur. It has a length of 34.3 centimeters, a diameter of 3.7 centimeters, and weighs 1.7 kilograms. According to the British Museum, it was found together with two other objects, a carved stone with handle and a lapis lazuli portrait, which together probably formed a foundation deposit.
The actual content of the inscription had been overlooked, until it was published by J.C. Gadd in 1928.

=== A'bunadh ===
A'bunadh is a cask-strength single malt whisky from the Aberlour Distillery in Scotland.  Though it has no age statement, it is released in limited run batches, each batch carrying a unique number on its label.
A'bunadh is exclusively aged in Spanish oak Oloroso sherry butts and therefore has a sweeter, softer flavour than most scotch. A'bunadh is not chill filtered.
The distillery cite the story during distillery tours that when the second pair of stills were put in during 1975, a time capsule was discovered behind the name plate, containing an 1898 newspaper about the distillery fire wrapped around an 1898 bottle of Aberlour. The workmen who discovered the bottle polished off four fifths of the bottle during their lunch break, but the remains of the bottle went off to the laboratories in Keith, Moray, and were analysed. A'bunadh is an attempt to recreate this single malt.
The name a'bunadh is described as the Scottish Gaelic for 'the original', though is possibly a misspelling of am bunadh, meaning 'the origin'.

=== A'gan ===
A'gan is a town of Qilihe District, Lanzhou, China. It is located in a mountainous area 20 kilometers south of Lanzhou's urban area. A'gan is located near a mountain pass on the route between Lanzhou and the historically important city of Lintao. The name A'gan is thought to be derived from an ancient folk song of the same name.
A'gan was established as early as 1083 as a fort, but it has been inhabited since prehistoric times, as shown by Majiayao culture ceramics found nearby. In 1182 it became A'gan County. In 1270, it was merged into Lanzhou. During the Ming Dynasty it was known as A'ganli. As early as 1268, coal mining started around the town, followed by pottery and iron industry,  making it the earliest place where coal was mined in Gansu. It was also a regional market town. The first public coal mine was opened in 1938. In 1949, the PLA captured Lanzhou from the south, passing through the pass at A'gan.
During the early years of the People's Republic of China, the Communist government further developed the coal mining industry in the area. On April 1, 1955 construction started on the 27 km (17 mi) Lan'a Railway for coal transport between Lanzhou and A'gan. The railway opened on February 5, 1956. At that time, A'gan was the most important coal mining site in Gansu. Coal mining continued with a peak of 1 million tons annually in 1971. In the 1980s, around 100,000 people were employed in the town, working in the mines and surrounding industries, many of them commuting from Lanzhou.
After the 1980s, the coal mines were closed as they became exhausted, and the town entered an economic decline. The town is developing tourism to revitalize the economy.

In 2018, Wilson was drafted first overall by the Las Vegas Aces. On May 21, 2018, in her career debut, Wilson scored 14 points along with 10 rebounds in a 101–65 loss to the Connecticut Sun. On June 16, 2018, Wilson scored a career-high of 35 points along with 13 rebounds in a 101–92 overtime victory against the Indiana Fever, becoming the second rookie in league history to score 35 points and grab 10 rebounds. Wilson would be voted into the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game. Later on in the season, Wilson would be named the WNBA Rookie of the Year. She was tied for third in scoring. Her season performance almost led the Aces to the playoffs as they finished 9th place with a 14–20 record.

On June 29, 2019, Wilson scored a new career-high 39 points in a 102–97 overtime victory against the Indiana Fever. In July, Wilson suffered an ankle injury that kept her out for 4 weeks, causing her to miss the 2019 WNBA All-Star Game. She made her return in mid-August. By the end of the season, the Aces finished with a 21–13 record and the number 4 seed, receiving a bye to the second round, helping the franchise get back to the playoffs for the first time since 2014. In the second round elimination game, the Aces beat the Chicago Sky 93–92 in a thriller game, where teammate Dearica Hamby came up with a steal and nailed the game-winning three from half-court with 4-second left. However, in the semi-finals, the Aces would lose in four games to the Washington Mystics, who would go on to win the 2019 WNBA championship.
In the 2020 season, the Aces were championship contenders. The season was delayed and shortened to 22 games in a bubble at IMG Academy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With her all-star teammate Liz Cambage sitting out the season due to health concerns, Wilson carried the team by putting up peak numbers, the Aces finishing the season 18-4 and the number 1 seed, receiving a double bye to the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, the Aces would defeat the Connecticut Sun in a hard-fought five-game series, advancing to the Finals for the second time in franchise history (first since relocating to Las Vegas); however with a shorthanded roster against a fully loaded Seattle Storm team, the Aces would be defeated in a three-game sweep. Wilson would end up winning the MVP award for the 2020 season.
In 2022, Wilson would win her second MVP and first Defensive Player of the Year award, averaging 19.5 points, 9.4 rebounds and 1.9 blocks while leading the league with 17 double-doubles. Wilson helped propel the Aces to their second finals appearance in three seasons, where they would defeat the Connecticut Sun in four games, giving Wilson her first championship.

On June 30, 2023, Wilson signed a contract extension with the Aces to keep herself in Las Vegas.
On August 22, 2023, Wilson achieved a new career high in points, scoring 53 points along with 7 rebounds in a 112–100 victory over the Atlanta Dream. Her 53-point showing tied the WNBA's single game record and is one of three 50-plus point performances in WNBA history.
Despite another strong 2023 regular season and being amongst the WNBA leaders in points, rebounds and blocks per game, Wilson fell short of garnering back-to-back MVP honors. She did, however, repeat as Defensive Player of the year in 2023.

Fueled by Wilson's late 2023 season dominance, the Aces swept their first two 2023 playoff series against the Chicago Sky and Dallas Wings, respectively. The Aces carried that momentum into the Finals against the New York Liberty, winning the first two games of the series at home, while extending their playoff winning streak to eight games. Despite a Game 3 setback on the Liberty's home floor and losing two starters to injury, Wilson and the Aces overcame a late double-digit Game 4 deficit to defeat the Liberty 70-69 and win their second consecutive WNBA title, the first back-to-back WNBA championship since the Los Angeles Sparks repeated as champs in 2001 and 2002. Wilson posted averages of 23.8 points and 11.8 rebounds per game in the 2023 WNBA Finals, which bested her 2023 regular season numbers of 22.8 points and 9.5 rebounds per game. She was awarded her first Finals MVP for her impressive performance in the Aces-Liberty series.
On June 5, 2024, in the match-up against the Dallas Wings, Wilson became the first player to have at least 35+ points, 10+ rebounds, and 5+ steals in a single game in WNBA history. On September 11, Wilson set the single-season scoring record against the Indiana Fever.

On June 21, 2021, Wilson was named to the 12-player roster for Team USA for the 2020 summer Olympics. She and Team USA went on to win the gold medal in the tournament, defeating Japan 90–75 in the final. At the conclusion of the tournament, Wilson was named to FIBA's All-Star Five team.


=== 2024 Summer Olympics ===
In June 2024, Wilson was again named to the US women's Olympic team to compete at the 2024 Summer Olympics in France, alongside fellow Aces teammates, Chelsea Gray, Kelsey Plum, and Jackie Young. Wilson led the United States to defeat France 67–66 in the final, earning Wilson her second consecutive gold medal and the United States' eighth consecutive gold medal. Wilson was named the MVP of the tournament after leading Team USA in points, rebounds, steals, blocks, field goals made, free throws made, and efficiency. She was also named to FIBA's All-Star Five team.

When playing basketball, Wilson frequently wears a single sleeve on her left leg, which originally started as a way for her to manage pain from an injury.

==== Commentary on racial bias in marketing of female athletes ====
Days after the announcement of Wilson's signature shoe, the A'One, with Nike, Wilson, in an interview with the Associated Press, agreed when asked, that white female athletes (including Indiana Fever rookie, Caitlin Clark) are often perceived as more marketable than black female athletes. She alluded to her own experience of needing incredible success in the WNBA before garnering high-level sponsorship and business deals (such as a signature shoe) as a black woman: "[corporations] don't see [people of color] as marketable, so it doesn't matter how hard I work. It doesn't matter what we all do as black women." Wilson's comments were made in light of recent reports from The Wall Street Journal and The Athletic that Clark and Nike were in negotiations for an eight-figure endorsement deal, including a signature shoe, effectively making Clark the fifth Caucasian active player in the WNBA (joining Elena Delle Donne, Diana Taurasi, Sabrina Ionescu, and Breanna Stewart) with a signature shoe. Before this Nike-Clark deal was reported, many fans, reporters, and fellow athletes had been asking for Nike to give Wilson a signature shoe, including Aces' head coach, Becky Hammon, and NBA star, LeBron James, given her accolades and exceptional performance in the WNBA and long-standing sponsorship with Nike.
On May 14, 2024, during the press conference before her professional debut in the WNBA, Clark was asked by Fox News Digital to respond to Wilson's commentary on Clark's rapid rise in popularity in relation to her race and stated, "I think there [are] opportunities for every single player in women's basketball ... the more opportunities we can give across the board, that's what's going to elevate women's basketball." She continued and added, "The parity in women's basketball is what's making more people want to come watch it. ... I've had a lot of fun being in the spotlight and helping grow this game and move it forward, and that's what I'm going to continue to do ... the more we can share the love, the better this league's going to be."

=== A'sha Hamdan ===
Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd Allah ibn al-Harith al-Hamdani (Arabic: عبد الرحمن بن عبد الله بن الحارث الهمداني), commonly known as A'sha Hamdan (أعشى همدان) (lit. 'the Night-Blind of the Hamdan') or al-A'sha (d. 701 or 702), was a late 7th-century Kufan poet.


== Life ==
A'sha was born in Kufa. He belonged to the South Arabian tribe of Hamdan. He began his career as a Muslim traditionist and qari (Quran reader) and was married to the sister of the prominent theologian Amir al-Sha'bi, who was married to A'sha's sister. He later shifted to poetry, purportedly after dreaming of being in a room full of 'barley' (shi'r, which has the dual meaning of 'poetry'). He served in the military campaigns of the Kufans during the governorship of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (r. 694–714), though evidently this was not always voluntary. One such campaign in Makran took a heavy toll on his health.
He campaigned under the Kufan commander Ibn al-Ash'ath in Daylam. According to one of his poems, he was taken captive there before gaining the love of a Daylamite woman who helped free him. He became akin to the spokesman of Ibn al-Ash'ath during the mass Iraqi rebellion he led against al-Hajjaj and the Umayyads in general. He was present at the Battle of Dayr al-Jamajim in 701 or 702 where Ibn al-Ash'ash was put to flight and al-A'sha captured by the Umayyad troops. He was brought before al-Hajjaj who condemned him for his critical verses against him and the Umayyads. His attempt to win al-Hajjaj's favor by reciting to him an ode of praise did not sway the governor, who had him executed.


== Poetry ==
The historian G. J. H. van Gelder describes A'sha's poetry as "an interesting mixture of the personal and the political". The Encyclopaedia of Islam calls his poems "reflexes of his adventures and political sentiments". In his poems, he often championed the Yaman (South Arabian) tribal faction to which he belonged, in opposition to the northern Arab faction. His poems would be turned into songs by his fellow Hamdani tribesman, the musician Ahmad al-Nasbi.
Al-Tabari preserved the following fragment of A'sha's poem praising Ibn al-Ash'ath (Abd al-Rahman) and condemning al-Hajjaj:

For a lover who has emerged in Zabulistan,  there have been two liars from Thaqif,  their past liar and a second one.  May my Lord give power to Hamdan over Thaqif  For a day until nighttime, so consoling us for what took place [before].  We betook ourselves to the devilish infidel,  When, in unbelief after belief, he exceeded the bounds,  with the noble lord Abd al-Rahman.  He set forth with a throng of Qahtan, like locusts  While from Ma'add ibn Adnan he brought  A tumultuous and might multitude.  So tell Hajjaj, Satan's friend, [if he can],  Stand steady against Madhhij and Hamdan,  that they will give him to drink from the goblet of poison,  And will send him off to the villages of Ibn Marwan.

=== A'tris ===
ā'trĭs  was an American indie rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 2003. The band currently consists of Mason Taylor (vocals, piano), Ben Azar (guitar), Nate Lueck (bass, background vocals, guitar), and Travis Abel (drums); while Michael Kreher and Chuck Sokol provide synthesized backdrops for live performances. In 2017, the band posted an extended play to SoundCloud, but their other social media accounts were deleted.


== History ==
The band was formed in 2003 by Mason Taylor and Michael Kreher, who were classmates at the Berklee College of Music. Other Berklee students were recruited to round out the band, including drummer Dave Lewis and guitarist Zach McLean. Another classmate, Chuck Sokol, was recruited to engineer the band's recordings. All of the band members later dropped out of Berklee.
After about two years, the band's lineup evolved to include Chris Ashworth (guitar), James Colazo (guitar), and Pete Wahlers (bass). This lineup recorded the debut ā'trĭs album Appeal, released in 2005. The album received positive reviews for its "cinematic" sound and similarities to R.E.M. and Radiohead. All members other than Taylor quit the band when faced the prospect of full-time touring, though Kreher remained involved as a producer alongside Sokol.
Pete Koopmans and Pat Speece were added to the band and contributed to the 2007 EP Of the Commons. Taylor recruited Azar, Lueck, and Abel for the band's second full-length album. That album, Lensing, was released in 2008. Reviewers compared the album to not just Radiohead, but also Jeff Buckley, Muse, and Coldplay.
In 2017, the band posted an extended play to SoundCloud titled Womb to War. Later that year, all social media accounts for the band except for the SoundCloud were deleted.

=== A'wesome ===
A'wesome is the fifth extended play (EP) by South Korean singer Hyuna. It was released on August 1, 2016, by Cube Entertainment and distributed by Universal Music. It marks her first release as a solo artist since the disbandment of girl group 4Minute. The EP consists of six Korean-language songs. "How's This?" was released as the lead single.


== Background ==
Girl group 4Minute, of which Hyuna was part of, disbanded in June 2016. Four of the members, Jihyun, Gayoon, Jiyoon, and Sohyun, parted ways with Cube Entertainment after their contract termination. Hyuna was the only member to renew her contract with the agency, and would continue her career as a solo artist.


== Release and promotion ==
Later in July, Cube confirmed that Hyuna will be returning as a solo artist on August 1 with the release of her 5th mini album A'wesome. On July 25, Hyuna dropped the first teaser images that were taken in Bali, Indonesia. It was also revealed that Hyuna will be promoting with the title track "How's This?". On July 28, Hyuna launched her official YouTube channel, and uploaded a highlight medley of her upcoming EP.
On August 1, the EP was released as a digital download on different music portals.  A music video for "How's This?" was also released on the same day. It was directed by Hong Won-ki of Zanybros, and was set on a club party that featured a hundred dancers. "How's This?" topped multiple real-time music charts upon its release, and the accompanying music video reached more than 2 million views within 24 hours.
Hyuna made her first music show performance on Music Bank on August 5. She performed the singles How's This?, U&ME and Freaky different times. The track "Do It" was deemed unfit for broadcast by KBS because the lyrics contain a vulgar expression.
On August 22, 2016, a video for the song "Morning Glory" was released on Hyuna's YouTube channel, featuring behind the scenes clips of the album's creation.


== Composition ==
The album tracks ranges from hip-hop to indie music genres. The title track of the album, "How's This?", is a trap and hip-hop song played in saxophone riff and 808 bass sound. It is produced by Seo Jaewoo, who also produced her previous works like "Red" and "Roll Deep". "Wolf" is an emotional hip-hop track that features rapper Hanhae. "U&Me" is described as a light song in an easy beat. "Morning Glory" is an indie-style song produced by singer-songwriter Seonwoo Jeong-a, and features indie musician, Qim Aisle. "Flirt" is a trap beat track. "Do it!" is produced by Seo Jaewoo, Big Sancho and American songwriter, Brian Lee. EXID's LE and BTOB's Jung Il-hoon also participated in the chorus and rap verse.


== Commercial performance ==
A'wesome entered and peaked at number 2 on the Gaon Album Chart on the chart issue dated July 31 – August 6, 2016. In its second week, the EP charted at number 33 before leaving the chart the following week.
The mini-album entered at number 12 on the Gaon Album Chart for the month of August 2016 with 9,224 physical copies sold.
The lead single "How's This?" entered at number 5 on the Gaon Digital Chart on the chart issue dated July 31- August 6, 2016 with 102,587 downloads sold and 2,201,140 streams.

=== A*Devantgarde ===
The A•DEvantgarde festival was founded in 1991 by Sandeep Bhagwati and Moritz Eggert. A•DEvantgarde is a music festival held every 2 years in Munich, Germany.
In 2007 the theme of the festival was on totalitarianism where the festival debuted the 60x60 project's Munich Mix featuring works with the theme of oppression and totalitarianism. In 2017, the festival will be directed by Samuel Penderbayne and Alexander Strauch under the motto 'Corragio' (courage), featuring local, national and international artists including Ensemble Nikel (Berlin/Tel Aviv), NAMES (Salzburg) and The Breakout Ensemble (Munich).


== History of the A•DEvantgarde Festival ==
"A•DEvantgarde" mixes the French words "avant" and "devant," to mean temporally and spatially progressing; an apt description of its intent.  The A•DEvantgarde Festival was formed in the late 1980s by a passionate group of young German composers who wanted to break from the traditional or  Darmstadt School  of  serial composition  that was dominated by eminent new music composers of the late 20th century including  Pierre Boulez,  Bruno Maderna,  Karlheinz Stockhausen and more.
Professor  Wilhelm Killmayer  championed the students' work, encouraging them to work together to present their music rather than to engage competitively for the diminutive space allotted to young composers in the larger musical venues. Professor Killmayer took on composer  Sandeep Bhagwati  as his teaching assistant, opening up a new level of resources for the young composer.  Bhagwati put together a first series of chamber concerts aimed at presenting the work of young composers called the A•DEvantgarde and even wrote a manifesto of the A•DEvantgarde which stated the group's intention to create and promote music that is without constraints or dictates—particularly as regards serial music.  The document continues to be regarded as controversial today.
The first festival was held in 1991 and met with great success; in fact, the A•DEvantgarde Festival required immediate expansion in its second year in order to accommodate the great number of attendees.  The second festival in 1992 was of a larger scale and was open to composers internationally.  Most importantly, it upheld the ideal that young composers should judge and decide upon the work of other young composers, and the core group went to great lengths to ensure that this process was consistently carried out.
Again outgrowing its capacity in the second year, the A*Devantgarde Festival was for financial reasons forced to scale back in 1993.  This occasioned a move to the New Theater, an intimate and minimalist space in which the performances thrived.
At the New Theater the popular audience continued to grow and the Festival began to receive critical acclaim.  The original founders, foremost among them  Sandeep Bhagwati  and  Moritz Eggert, felt that they were already coming to an age where they should step aside and let the younger composers make many of the aesthetic decisions.  The group opted to use a democratic method whereby all members voted on which compositions to include and how best to direct the Festival, a process that was "laborious but always rewarding."  
In the following years the A•DEvantgarde Festival began to receive performances across Germany, becoming a new standard for aspiring composers.
The upcoming festival in 2017 includes a mixture of concert performances and interdisciplinary projects involving artists from the free-scene. The centrepiece of the festival will be a 3-day 'Happening' in front of the Gasteig Centre for Arts and Culture in Munich on the theme 'An Artistic Occupy'. Broadly speaking, the music of the 1% will be laid bare on the steps of the Gastieg, the 'Wall St. of Culture' in Munich, and all performances will have a focus on 'inclusion'. Other features of the festival include a 'Quodlibet' with various choirs from the local scene, an evening of premieres of works setting the poetry of Ernst Toller (and associates), and concerts by Ensemble Nikel (Berlin/Tel Aviv) and NAMES (Salzburg). The artistic directors for 2017 are Samuel Penderbayne and Alexander Strauch.

=== A*STAR Talent Search ===
The A*STAR Talent Search (ATS) is a research-based science competition in Singapore for high school students between 15–21 years of age.  It was formerly known as National Science Talent Search. The ATS is an annual competition which acknowledges and rewards students who have a strong aptitude for science & technology. This competition provides students the opportunity to showcase their stellar projects and encourage them to further explore science and technology.
The ATS is administered by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Science Centre Singapore (SCS) from 2006. Participants are required to compete in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) and winners from the fair will then proceed to the short-listing round of ATS. The panel of judges consists of distinguished scientists from local and international universities, as well as A*STAR research institutes and a Nobel Laureate as the Chief Judge. ATS winners need to display resourcefulness, mastery of scientific concepts, as well as passion for scientific research.
The First Prize winner will be given S$5000, inclusive of a sponsored overseas conference.
Winners and finalists (top 8 students) of the ATS have gone on to top universities worldwide, such as National University of Singapore, Harvard University, Princeton University, Yale University, Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and California Institute of Technology in the United States, and University of Cambridge, University of Oxford and Imperial College London in the United Kingdom.

=== A* search algorithm ===
A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm that is used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. Given a weighted graph, a source node and a goal node, the algorithm finds the shortest path (with respect to the given weights) from source to goal.
One major practical drawback is its 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          b
          
            d
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(b^{d})}
  
 space complexity where d is the depth of the solution (the length of the shortest path)  and b is the branching factor (the maximum number of successors for a state), as it stores all generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms that can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, as well as by memory-bounded approaches; however, A* is still the best solution in many cases.
Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) first published the algorithm in 1968. It can be seen as an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm. A* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search.
Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, the A* algorithm only finds the shortest path from a specified source to a specified goal, and not the shortest-path tree from a specified source to all possible goals. This is a necessary trade-off for using a specific-goal-directed heuristic. For Dijkstra's algorithm, since the entire shortest-path tree is generated, every node is a goal, and there can be no specific-goal-directed heuristic.


== History ==

A* was created as part of the Shakey project, which had the aim of building a mobile robot that could plan its own actions. Nils Nilsson originally proposed using the Graph Traverser algorithm for Shakey's path planning. Graph Traverser is guided by a heuristic function h(n), the estimated distance from node n to the goal node: it entirely ignores g(n), the distance from the start node to n. Bertram Raphael suggested using the sum, g(n) + h(n). Peter Hart invented the concepts we now call admissibility and consistency of heuristic functions. A* was originally designed for finding least-cost paths when the cost of a path is the sum of its  costs, but it has been shown that A* can be used to find optimal paths for any problem satisfying the conditions of a cost algebra.
The original 1968 A* paper contained a theorem stating that no A*-like algorithm could expand fewer nodes than A* if the heuristic function is consistent and A*'s tie-breaking rule is suitably chosen. A "correction" was published a few years later claiming that consistency was not required, but this was shown to be false in 1985 in Dechter and Pearl's definitive study of A*'s optimality (now called optimal efficiency), which gave an example of A* with a heuristic that was admissible but not consistent expanding arbitrarily more nodes than an alternative A*-like algorithm.


== Description ==

A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.).  It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until the goal node is reached.
At each iteration of its main loop, A* needs to determine which of its paths to extend. It does so based on the cost of the path and an estimate of the cost required to extend the path all the way to the goal. Specifically, A* selects the path that minimizes

  
    
      
        f
        (
        n
        )
        =
        g
        (
        n
        )
        +
        h
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(n)=g(n)+h(n)}
  

where n is the next node on the path, g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n, and h(n) is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal. The heuristic function is problem-specific. If the heuristic function is admissible – meaning that it never overestimates the actual cost to get to the goal – A* is guaranteed to return a least-cost path from start to goal.
Typical implementations of A* use a priority queue to perform the repeated selection of minimum (estimated) cost nodes to expand. This priority queue is known as the open set, fringe or frontier. At each step of the algorithm, the node with the lowest f(x) value is removed from the queue, the f and g values of its neighbors are updated accordingly, and these neighbors are added to the queue. The algorithm continues until a removed node (thus the node with the lowest f value out of all fringe nodes) is a goal node. The f value of that goal is then also the cost of the shortest path, since h at the goal is zero in an admissible heuristic.
The algorithm described so far only gives the length of the shortest path. To find the actual sequence of steps, the algorithm can be easily revised so that each node on the path keeps track of its predecessor. After this algorithm is run, the ending node will point to its predecessor, and so on, until some node's predecessor is the start node.
As an example, when searching for the shortest route on a map, h(x) might represent the straight-line distance to the goal, since that is physically the smallest possible distance between any two points. For a grid map from a video game, using the Taxicab distance or the Chebyshev distance becomes better depending on the set of movements available (4-way or 8-way).
If the heuristic h satisfies the additional condition h(x) ≤ d(x, y) + h(y) for every edge (x, y) of the graph (where d denotes the length of that edge), then h is called monotone, or consistent. With a consistent heuristic, A* is guaranteed to find an optimal path without processing any node more than once and A* is equivalent to running Dijkstra's algorithm with the reduced cost d'(x, y) = d(x, y) + h(y) − h(x).


=== Pseudocode ===
The following pseudocode describes the algorithm:

Remark: In this pseudocode, if a node is reached by one path, removed from openSet, and subsequently reached by a cheaper path, it will be added to openSet again. This is essential to guarantee that the path returned is optimal if the heuristic function is admissible but not  consistent.   If the heuristic is consistent, when a node is removed from openSet the path to it is guaranteed to be optimal so the test ‘tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]’ will always fail if the node is reached again. The pseudocode implemented here is sometimes called the graph-search version of A*. This is in contrast with the version without the ‘tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]’ test to add nodes back to openSet, which is sometimes called the tree-search version of A* and require a consistent heuristic to guarantee optimality.


=== Example ===
An example of an A* algorithm in action where nodes are cities connected with roads and h(x) is the     straight-line distance to the target point:

Key: green: start; blue: goal; orange: visited
The A* algorithm has real-world applications. In this example, edges are railroads and h(x) is the great-circle distance (the shortest possible distance on a sphere) to the target. The algorithm is searching for a path between Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.


=== Implementation details ===
There are a number of simple optimizations or implementation details that can significantly affect the performance of an A* implementation.  The first detail to note is that the way the priority queue handles ties can have a significant effect on performance in some situations.  If ties are broken so the queue behaves in a LIFO manner, A* will behave like depth-first search among equal cost paths (avoiding exploring more than one equally optimal solution).
When a path is required at the end of the search, it is common to keep with each node a reference to that node's parent.  At the end of the search, these references can be used to recover the optimal path.  If these references are being kept then it can be important that the same node doesn't appear in the priority queue more than once (each entry corresponding to a different path to the node, and each with a different cost).  A standard approach here is to check if a node about to be added already appears in the priority queue.  If it does, then the priority and parent pointers are changed to correspond to the lower-cost path. A standard binary heap based priority queue does not directly support the operation of searching for one of its elements, but it can be augmented with a hash table that maps elements to their position in the heap, allowing this decrease-priority operation to be performed in logarithmic time. Alternatively, a Fibonacci heap can perform the same decrease-priority operations in constant amortized time.


=== Special cases ===
Dijkstra's algorithm, as another example of a uniform-cost search algorithm, can be viewed as a special case of A* where ⁠
  
    
      
        h
        (
        x
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(x)=0}
  
⁠ for all x. General depth-first search can be implemented using A* by considering that there is a global counter C initialized with a very large value. Every time we process a node we assign C to all of its newly discovered neighbors. After every single assignment, we decrease the counter C by one. Thus the earlier a node is discovered, the higher its ⁠
  
    
      
        h
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(x)}
  
⁠ value. Both Dijkstra's algorithm and depth-first search can be implemented more efficiently without including an ⁠
  
    
      
        h
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(x)}
  
⁠ value at each node.


== Properties ==


=== Termination and completeness ===
On finite graphs with non-negative edge weights A* is guaranteed to terminate and is complete, i.e. it will always find a solution (a path from start to goal) if one exists. On infinite graphs with a finite branching factor and edge costs that are bounded away from zero (
  
    
      
        d
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        >
        ε
        >
        0
      
    
    {\textstyle d(x,y)>\varepsilon >0}
  
 for some fixed 
  
    
      
        ε
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon }
  
), A* is guaranteed to terminate only if there exists a solution.


=== Admissibility ===
A search algorithm is said to be admissible if it is guaranteed to return an optimal solution. If the heuristic function used by A* is admissible, then A* is admissible. An intuitive "proof" of this  is as follows:
Call a node closed if it has been visited and is not in the open set.  We close a node when we remove it from the open set.  A basic property of the A* algorithm, which we'll sketch a proof of below, is that when ⁠
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
⁠ is closed, ⁠
  
    
      
        f
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(n)}
  
⁠ is an optimistic estimate (lower bound) of the true distance from the start to the goal.  So when the goal node, ⁠
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  
⁠, is closed, ⁠
  
    
      
        f
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(g)}
  
⁠ is no more than the true distance.  On the other hand, it is no less than the true distance, since it is the length of a path to the goal plus a heuristic term.
Now we'll see that whenever a node ⁠
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
⁠ is closed, ⁠
  
    
      
        f
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(n)}
  
⁠ is an optimistic estimate.  It is enough to see that whenever the open set is not empty, it has at least one node ⁠
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
⁠ on an optimal path to the goal for which ⁠
  
    
      
        g
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(n)}
  
⁠ is the true distance from start, since in that case ⁠
  
    
      
        g
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(n)}
  
⁠ + ⁠
  
    
      
        h
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(n)}
  
⁠ underestimates the distance to goal, and therefore so does the smaller value chosen for the closed vertex. Let ⁠
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
⁠ be an optimal path from the start to the goal.  Let ⁠
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  
⁠ be the last closed node on ⁠
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
⁠ for which ⁠
  
    
      
        g
        (
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(p)}
  
⁠ is the true distance from the start to the goal (the start is one such vertex).  The next node in ⁠
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  
⁠ has the correct ⁠
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  
⁠ value, since it was updated when ⁠
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  
⁠ was closed, and it is open since it is not closed.


=== Optimality and consistency ===
Algorithm A is optimally efficient with respect to a set of alternative algorithms Alts on a set of problems P if for every problem P in P and every algorithm A′ in Alts, the set of nodes expanded by A in solving P is a subset (possibly equal) of the set of nodes expanded by A′ in solving P. The definitive study of the optimal efficiency of A* is due to Rina Dechter and Judea Pearl.
They considered a variety of  definitions of Alts and P  in combination with A*'s heuristic being merely admissible or being both consistent and admissible.  The most interesting positive result they proved is that A*, with a consistent heuristic, is optimally efficient with respect to all admissible A*-like search algorithms on all "non-pathological" search problems.  Roughly speaking, their notion of the non-pathological problem is what we now mean by "up to tie-breaking".  This result does not hold if A*'s heuristic is admissible but not consistent. In that case, Dechter and Pearl showed there exist admissible A*-like algorithms that can expand arbitrarily fewer nodes than A* on some non-pathological problems.
Optimal efficiency is about the set of nodes expanded, not the number of node expansions (the number of iterations of A*'s main loop).  When the heuristic being used is admissible but not consistent, it is possible for a node to be expanded by A* many times, an exponential number of times in the worst case.
In such circumstances, Dijkstra's algorithm could outperform A* by a large margin. However, more recent research found that this pathological case only occurs in certain contrived situations where the edge weight of the search graph is exponential in the size of the graph and that certain inconsistent (but admissible) heuristics can lead to a reduced number of node expansions in A* searches.


== Bounded relaxation ==

While the admissibility criterion guarantees an optimal solution path, it also means that A* must examine all equally meritorious paths to find the optimal path. To compute approximate shortest paths, it is possible to speed up the search at the expense of optimality by relaxing the admissibility criterion. Oftentimes we want to bound this relaxation, so that we can guarantee that the solution path is no worse than (1 + ε) times the optimal solution path. This new guarantee is referred to as ε-admissible.
There are a number of ε-admissible algorithms:

Weighted A*/Static Weighting's. If ha(n) is an admissible heuristic function, in the weighted version of the A* search one uses hw(n) = ε ha(n), ε > 1 as the heuristic function, and perform the A* search as usual (which eventually happens faster than using ha since fewer nodes are expanded). The path hence found by the search algorithm can have a cost of at most ε times that of the least cost path in the graph.
Convex Upward/Downward Parabola (XUP/XDP).  Modification to the cost function in weighted A* to push optimality toward the start or goal.  XDP gives paths which are near optimal close to the start, and XUP paths are near-optimal close to the goal. Both yield 
  
    
      
        ϵ

        λ
        ≤
        Λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda \leq \Lambda }
  
, π(n) is the parent of n, and ñ is the most recently expanded node.


== Complexity ==
As a heuristic search algorithm, the performance of A* is heavily influenced by the quality of the heuristic function 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\textstyle h(n)}
  
. If the heuristic closely approximates the true cost to the goal, A* can significantly reduce the number of node expansions. On the other hand, a poor heuristic can lead to many unnecessary expansions.


=== Worst-Case Scenario ===
In the worst case, A* expands all nodes 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\textstyle n}
  
 for which 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        n
        )
        =
        g
        (
        n
        )
        +
        h
        (
        n
        )
        ≤
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(n)=g(n)+h(n)\leq C^{*}}
  
, where 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle C^{*}}
  
 is the cost of the optimal goal node.


==== Why can’t it be worse ====
Suppose there is a node 
  
    
      
        
          N
          ′
        
      
    
    {\textstyle N'}
  
 in the open list with 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          N
          ′
        
        )
        >
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(N')>C^{*}}
  
, and it's the next node to be expanded. Since the goal node has 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        g
        o
        a
        l
        )
        =
        g
        (
        g
        o
        a
        l
        )
        +
        h
        (
        g
        o
        a
        l
        )
        =
        g
        (
        g
        o
        a
        l
        )
        =
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(goal)=g(goal)+h(goal)=g(goal)=C^{*}}
  
, and 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          N
          ′
        
        )
        >
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(N')>C^{*}}
  
, the goal node will have a lower f-value and will be expanded before 
  
    
      
        
          N
          ′
        
      
    
    {\textstyle N'}
  
. Therefore, A* never expands nodes with 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        n
        )
        >
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(n)>C^{*}}
  
.


==== Why can’t it be better ====
Assume there exists an optimal algorithm that expands fewer nodes than 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle C^{*}}
  
 in the worst case using the same heuristic. That means there must be some node 
  
    
      
        
          N
          ′
        
      
    
    {\textstyle N'}
  
 such that 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          N
          ′
        
        )
        <
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(N')<C^{*}}
  
, yet the algorithm chooses not to expand it.
Now consider a modified graph where a new edge of cost 
  
    
      
        ε
      
    
    {\textstyle \varepsilon }
  
 (with 
  
    
      
        ε
        >
        0
      
    
    {\textstyle \varepsilon >0}
  
) is added from 
  
    
      
        
          N
          ′
        
      
    
    {\textstyle N'}
  
 to the goal. If 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          N
          ′
        
        )
        +
        ε
        <
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(N')+\varepsilon <C^{*}}
  
, then the new optimal path goes through 
  
    
      
        
          N
          ′
        
      
    
    {\textstyle N'}
  
. However, since the algorithm still avoids expanding 
  
    
      
        
          N
          ′
        
      
    
    {\textstyle N'}
  
, it will miss the new optimal path, violating its optimality.
Therefore, no optimal algorithm including A* could expand fewer nodes than 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle C^{*}}
  
 in the worst case.


==== Mathematical Notation ====
The worst-case complexity of A* is often described as 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          b
          
            d
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\textstyle O(b^{d})}
  
, where 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  
 is the branching factor and 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\textstyle d}
  
 is the depth of the shallowest goal. While this gives a rough intuition, it does not precisely capture the actual behavior of A*.
A more accurate bound considers the number of nodes with 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        n
        )
        ≤
        
          C
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(n)\leq C^{*}}
  
. If 
  
    
      
        ε
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon }
  
 is the smallest possible difference in 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\textstyle f}
  
-cost between distinct nodes, then A* may expand up to:

This represents both the time and space complexity in the worst case.


=== Space Complexity ===
The space complexity of A* is roughly the same as that of all other graph search algorithms, as it keeps all generated nodes in memory. In practice, this turns out to be the biggest drawback of the A* search, leading to the development of memory-bounded heuristic searches, such as Iterative deepening A*, memory-bounded A*, and SMA*.


== Applications ==
A* is often used for the common pathfinding problem in applications such as video games, but was originally designed as a general graph traversal algorithm.
It finds applications in diverse problems, including the problem of parsing using stochastic grammars in NLP.
Other cases include an Informational search with online learning.


== Relations to other algorithms ==
What sets A* apart from a greedy best-first search algorithm is that it takes the cost/distance already traveled, g(n), into account.
Some common variants of Dijkstra's algorithm can be viewed as a special case of A* where the heuristic 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        n
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(n)=0}
  
 for all nodes; in turn, both Dijkstra and A* are special cases of dynamic programming.
A* itself is a special case of a generalization of branch and bound.
A* is similar to beam search except that beam search maintains a limit on the numbers of paths that it has to explore.


== Variants ==
Anytime A*
Block A*
D*
Field D*
Fringe
Fringe Saving A* (FSA*)
Generalized Adaptive A* (GAA*)
Incremental heuristic search
Reduced A*
Iterative deepening A* (IDA*)
Jump point search
Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*)
New Bidirectional A* (NBA*)
Simplified Memory bounded A* (SMA*)
Theta*
A* can also be adapted to a bidirectional search algorithm, but special care needs to be taken for the stopping criterion.

=== A*mazing ===
A*mazing is an Australian children's television game show that aired from 16 May 1994 until 1998 on the Seven Network. It was famous for a relatively large and elaborate maze/obstacle course that was part of the show's studio set. A*mazing was hosted by James Sherry for the entire run of the series. A*mazing was produced at Channel 7 in Brisbane from 1994 to 1996 and then at Channel 7 in Perth from 1997 to 1998.


== Format ==
The show pitted teams from two different primary schools against each other during the course of a week. Points gained by each contestant during the week would be totalled up to decide the winning school at the end of each week. There were two rounds of a game called "Timezone", each followed by a maze run, then the contestants competed in a "computer challenge" on a video game.


=== Timezone ===
In Timezone, a 90-second countdown timer begins, and Sherry begins to provide clues to a word or phrase to the first school's contestants. Contestants have to correctly guess the word or phrase before running down to a large QWERTY keyboard mounted on the floor and stepping on the letters to spell it out. The process is repeated for the second school. If contestants were unable to guess the word initially, the clues would get easier until the word was spelled out by Sherry. The time remaining determines how many points they get, plus how long each school gets to spend in the maze during round two.


=== Maze Run ===
After both teams had completed Timezone, one contestant from each school would enter the maze and attempt to collect the letters of the answer which are hidden in such places as a garbage can, or behind a mock cactus. Ten points are given for every letter they retrieve inside the maze before their time runs out.
Occasionally, the maze would include letters that are not part of the answer; if a contestant collected these superfluous letters, they would not receive any extra points in addition to the points earned by collecting the valid letters.


=== Computer Challenge ===
After the teams had completed two maze runs, the contestants competed in a video game face off. During the course of the show, three different gaming platforms, all provided by sponsor Nintendo, were used. Originally, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1994–1996) was, and later the Nintendo 64 (1997–1998).
Games played included Tetris, Bubsy, Donkey Kong Country, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, Super Mario World, Nigel Mansell's World Championship, Plok, Pac-Attack, 1080° Snowboarding, Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, Wave Race 64, Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, San Francisco Rush, Multi-Racing Championship, Cruis'n USA, Diddy Kong Racing, Super Mario 64, Unirally, Winter Gold, Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Tennis, Cruis'n World, and the fly-swatting minigame from Mario Paint.
The team with the most points/fastest time win 50 points for their team, while runners-up in this challenge win 25 points for their team. Should there be a tie (e.g. both teams score the same number of coins in Super Mario Kart or hit the same number of flies in the fly-swatting mini-game from Mario Paint), both teams score 25 points each. Originally, 100 points were awarded to the winners and 50 points to the runners-up.


=== Bonus Round ===
After the third round, the team with the highest score would then go back to the maze for 90 seconds (later changed to 120 seconds) to collect keys. One player will choose which side of the maze they want to explore. Only when that player exits that maze can the other player enter the other half of the maze. There were seven keys, including a bonus one, in the maze; each key was worth 100 points. If either of the contestants found the bonus key, then both of the contestants would each get an original Game Boy (also provided by Nintendo), which later became a Game Boy Pocket. Only once were all seven keys found in the maze (under the 90-second rule limit).
If there was a tie after the third round, a sudden-death question was read out to both teams in the style of the first round, and whoever answered the question correctly would technically win the game for the day and go into the maze to search for the keys.
By the end of the week, the school with the highest number of points would win a grand prize, which was usually educational computer software or an encyclopedia set. Other prizes included tickets to the Wet'n'Wild theme park in Gold Coast, Australia.


== The Maze ==

The tables below show the layout of the maze per season, from the start to the end of each side of the maze.

The only parts of the maze that remained for every series were (left to right, start to finish): the mirrored doors, the pipe, the pirate's cove, the desert, the bamboo walk, the yellow slide and the padded stairs.
There was only one occasion during the entire run of the show when host James Sherry was shown to venture into the maze during the game portion of the show. During series two, one player from the winning team grabbed one key and got the key entangled in the fish net at the start of the left-hand side of the maze. After 30 seconds of trying to untangle it, James told them that the key was theirs. After the run, James ventured into the maze to count the keys they collected from the fish net.
At one time during a maze run, at the end of the jungle walk, a contestant went over a fence and into the right-hand side of the maze.
One of the most common locations to find the bonus key was in the car; unfortunately, most of the time, the key in the car was not found.
The shortest ever maze run was 5 seconds, after one team took 85 seconds to correctly answer and type "Todd Woodbridge" (most letters to type at 14). The team managed to grab an "S", but because "S" is not in "Todd Woodbridge", the team managed to only score 5 points (the lowest ever in a round).
Towards the end of the show's run, parts of the set from another show on the Seven Network, Time Masters, appeared on the set of A*mazing as part of the maze. A modified version of the Zig-Zag Run (called "The Wobbly Planks" on Time Masters) from the 'BrainStrain' game appeared on the castle, and the Revolving Pipe (called "The Groove Tube" on Time Masters) replaced the green pipe at the entrance to the pirates' cove. It was also taken from the 'BrainStrain' game, which had been phased out of Time Masters after the first season, in favour of 'Slam Dunk'—which was played with a basketball instead.
The jungle obstacle in the final season featured the Three Wise Monkeys, who were designed after Donkey Kong.
Peter Taylor became the first-ever contestant to win the major prize (the Game Boy) on A*mazing.
Controversially, if contestants chose the left route in the maze, they had to step into a smoke-filled pit. At the base of this pit were thousands of ping-pong balls. These balls sometimes made the contestants fall back onto their spine on a hard edge. The balls were removed after the first two episodes.


== Trivia ==

The show was rerun from 1999 to 2003 on Disney Channel.
On 9 August 2012, host James Sherry uploaded a video and started a Facebook page urging someone to bring back A*mazing. He has since uploaded 30 videos, but so far there are no official plans to bring the show back at this stage.

=== A+A ===
A+A is an international trade fair for occupational safety and health and occupational medicine, held every two years in Düsseldorf, Germany. Established in 1954, it features various forums, seminars, and live demonstrations, and hosts the German Occupational Safety Award (Deutscher Arbeitsschutzpreis). Offshoots of A+A exist in China, Turkey, and Singapore.


== History ==
A+A was founded in Düsseldorf in 1954 and initially focused on occupational safety and occupational medicine. Organized by Messe Düsseldorf, it evolved into a major platform for knowledge exchange and innovation in these fields.
From the 1960s onward, the fair attracted an increasing number of international exhibitors and visitors, aided by strategic marketing and partnerships. The 1970s saw more participation from overseas, particularly from the United States and Asia, broadening the fair’s international scope.
During the 1980s, A+A adapted its profile to reflect the changing world of work, highlighting new topics such as ergonomics, workplace health promotion, and technological advances in occupational safety. Lectures and panel discussions were added to address emerging trends.
Until 2019, the German Occupational Safety Award was presented as part of the fair, honoring outstanding projects and innovative solutions in occupational safety.


=== Recent developments ===
Since 2021, A+A has incorporated hybrid formats—combining in-person and digital elements—to reach a broader audience. In 2023, it hosted over 2,200 exhibitors and welcomed around 62,000 trade visitors from 140 countries, with a spotlight on digitalization and sustainability.


== Concept ==


=== Topics and focal points ===
A+A covers a wide range of issues related to occupational safety, workplace health promotion, and ergonomic workplace design. Increasingly, it focuses on the digital transformation of work and sustainable solutions in occupational health and safety.


=== Exhibitors and visitors ===
With more than 2,200 exhibitors and tens of thousands of visitors, A+A is one of the world’s largest events of its kind. It draws an international audience, including key decision-makers from the fields of safety, health, and workplace management.


=== Congress and forums ===
Held alongside the trade fair is the international A+A Congress, organized by the Federal Association for Occupational Safety and Health (Basi), which addresses national and global workplace safety issues. Beyond the fair and congress, A+A offers specialized forums, seminars, and live demonstrations.
Forums such as the A+A Trend Forum and WearRAcon Europe explore topics including exoskeletons, digitalization, and sustainable work practices, providing opportunities for expert dialogue.

The A+D Museum is a museum of architecture and design located in the Downtown Los Angeles Arts District at 900 E 4th Street. Designer and educator Natasha Sandmeier serves as the museum's executive director and Camille Elston is the managing director.


== History ==
A+D Museum was founded by Stephen Kanner and Bernard Zimmerman in 2001. Kanner was inspired by a similar museum he had visited in Helsinki, Finland.
The museum first opened its doors in January 2001 in the Bradbury Building, located at 304 South Broadway (3rd Street and Broadway) in downtown Los Angeles; a space donated by Ira Yellin. When the Bradbury building was sold in 2003 the museum moved to a temporary location on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. In 2006 it moved to 5900 Wilshire Boulevard; across the street from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In April 2010, the museum moved down the street to 6032 Wilshire Boulevard. Displaced by the extension of the Metro Purple Line, A+D Museum returned to downtown Los Angeles to a former warehouse in the Arts District in the summer of 2015.

=== A+E (album) ===
A+E is the eighth studio album by British singer-songwriter Graham Coxon, released on 2 April 2012 through Parlophone. The album was made as a "reaction" against Coxon's prior album, The Spinning Top, which consisted of psychedelic folk songs. A+E, on the other hand, consists of pop rock songs. Coxon, who is also the guitarist of Blur, recorded 21 songs during the album's two-month-long recording process with producer Ben Hillier. The 11 songs that did not make it onto A+E were divided into a separate album that was supposed to be released in late 2012, but Coxon was never announced it as of 2025. The album received positive reviews from critics, although some criticized its songs for being too long. Despite its critical success, it was Coxon's least successful album on the UK Albums Chart since The Kiss of Morning, peaking at number 39 and staying on the chart for only one week.


== Background ==
A+E started as a "reaction" against Coxon's previous album, The Spinning Top, a mostly acoustic album. According to Coxon, the songs were difficult to play, resulting in some audiences being unsatisfied in "venues that weren't set up for that sort of thing". Producer Ben Hillier described the recording of the album as "quick" and "fun", due to him trying to record Coxon's first takes on songs when it was possible. In 2 months, Coxon was able to record 21 tracks; 10 of them made it onto A+E, while the other 11 were grouped into an album that was expected be released in late 2012. According to Hillier, the latter is "less riff-based" and more "soul-influenced, with backing singers and strings.


== Composition ==
The title of A+E refers to Accident and Emergency rooms, while its cover art is a picture of a scraped knee. Coxon himself took the picture. Most of the songs on it feature synths and drum machine beats. The single "What'll It Take" is an upbeat song that features two vocal hooks: "What'll it take to make you people dance?" and "I don't know what's really wrong with me". A music video was released for it. "Seven Naked Valleys" is a post-punk track featuring saxophone that ends with "piercing synth frequency". Opening track "Advice" and "Running for Your Life" have "buzzsaw-guitar" and sardonic lyrics on culture. The former's lyrics are about a bad experience Coxon had at a house party in Brentwood, Essex. At the party, he and some other friends danced to a Smiths record that they used to replace another tape which was playing. As a result, they got beaten up and spent the rest of the night walking around Brentwood thinking of how they would get home. The latter's lyrics are about the "violence of a suburban night out." "Bah Singer" has indecipherable distorted lyrics, and the following track, "Knife in the Cast", is a ballad driven by bass guitar. The final track, "Ooh, Yeh Yeh", is a grunge-pop song that has been described as a "cowboy lullaby".


== Reception ==

A+E received positive reviews from critics, indicated by a score of 76 on review aggregate site upon which was voted Metacritic, denoting "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five, writing "Beneath all the clatter, A+E has the pop punch of his pair of Stephen Street-music production mid-2000s masterworks Happiness in Magazines and Love Travels at Illegal Speeds, and the combination of precisely crafted pop and fiercely imaginative arrangements results in a thrilling listen." The NME wrote that "the sulky, surly, passive-aggressive Graham we know and love has returned with a vengeance, and rediscovered his finest bomb-blast guitar work." Its reviewer Tom Pinnock called the album "one of the best albums of [Coxon's] career – a pop record with dangerously anti-social tendencies."
The Guardian gave A+E four out of five stars, writing "Coxon's wilfully abrasive eighth solo album might bring him full circle, but it also sends him spiralling into thrilling new territory." Pitchfork was not as positive and gave it 6.7 out of 10 commenting that a listener would be "left wishing the album drew a little more blood to make the stay truly worthwhile." Publications like The Independent were even less favorable; reviewer Andy Gill stated that "lingering this long among a cast of 'wasted people in a wasted world' leaves a grim aftertaste", although he did name "Running for Your Life", "Meet and Drink and Pollinate", and "What'll It Take" as highlights of the album. A+E peaked at number thirty-nine on the UK Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for one week.

=== A+E (song) ===
"A+E" is the debut single by British electronic group Clean Bandit, featuring vocals by Kandaka Moore and Nikki Cislyn. It was released on 7 December 2012 as the first single from their debut album, New Eyes. The song peaked at number 100 on the UK Singles Chart, but received mixed critical reception. The song's music video contains a CGI snake.


== Background ==
The track was written by Jack Patterson while he was waiting for fellow band member Grace Chatto in the accident and emergency department of Whittington Hospital, North London. The track was originally released in 2012 as a double A-Side with "Nightingale". Both tracks feature Cislyn; only A&E features Moore. The album version of the song includes a string trio arrangement of Johann Sebastian Bach's St. Matthew Passion (BMV 244) Pt. 2, number 54.
The track was recorded in Clean Bandit's studio in South Kilburn, London. Moore and Cislyn were recruited from a local community singing and dancing group next to South Kilburn Studios; the studios had a scheme in which artists could use the studios for free if a trainee was taken on.


== Music video ==
The music video contains a CGI snake. Band member Jack Patterson taught himself CGI animation for the video. He had the idea for a snake for a year previously, and said that "it was quite daunting having to make it a reality learning how to use 3D animation software on the hoof". The video contains two dancers, Rhys Dennis and Kandaka Moore, who – over the course of two hours – were painted gold (using stop-frame animation, the whole process takes about 25 seconds) and then went into central London.


== Critical reception ==
Critical reception was mixed. MTVIggy.com said that the song was "a funky hodgepodge of elements from the soul-sangin’ vocalists, calypso-flecked xylophone chimes and sharp snare drum beats". Joe Zadeh from Clash magazine called it "a throwaway ode to UK funky".

=== A+E Global Media ===
A&E Television Networks, LLC, doing business as A+E Global Media (formerly A+E Networks) is an American multinational broadcasting company owned and operated as a 50–50 joint venture between Hearst Communications and The Walt Disney Company through the General Entertainment Content unit of its Entertainment division. It owns several non-fiction and entertainment-based television brands, including A&E, History Channel, Lifetime, FYI and their associated sister channels, as well as holding stakes in, or licenses, their international branches.


== History ==
A&E was formed from the merger of the Alpha Repertory Television Service and the Entertainment Channel, a premium cable channel, in 1984 with their respective owners keeping stakes in the new company. Thus A&E's shareholders were Hearst and ABC (from ARTS) and Radio City Music Hall (Rockefeller Group) and RCA, then the parent of NBC (from Entertainment Channel). The company launched A&E, at the time known as the Arts & Entertainment Network, on February 1, 1984, as a block on Nickelodeon to fill in the time slot that ARTS held, as ARTS was a block on Nick. In 1985, the partners spun off A&E into its own 24 hour channel, and Nickelodeon later created Nick at Nite to fill in the time slot that A&E formerly held.
In 1990, after having aired episodes of its original 1960's version starting in 1987, A&E acquired rights to, and started producing new episodes of, the documentary series Biography— which became the channel's flagship program. The network also introduced its own companion magazine A&E Monthly.
The company indicated that plans for a history channel were in the works in 1993; it purchased the Lou Reda Productions documentary library and long-term rights for the Hearst Entertainment documentaries archive. In June 1993, the Rockefeller Group's Radio City Music Hall sold its 12.5% stake in A&E to the other three partners (now including NBC in place of RCA after GE's purchase of the latter in 1986) with NBC owning 25% and the other two 37.5% each. Also that month, a new production unit was set up.


=== A&E Networks ===

The A&E channel expanded to Canada, and later Mexico from 1993 to 1994. Biography began airing 5 nights a week in 1994. Also in 1994, A&E, on its 10th anniversary, changed its name from Arts and Entertainment to A&E.
A&E Networks launched the History Channel on January 1, 1995, with its UK counterpart following on November 1 in partnership with British Sky Broadcasting. A&E Networks considered History to be the driver in international expansion due to a lack of international rights to A&E international co-productions. As expected, the History Channel led A&E's overseas expansion in Brazil with TVA (April 1996), the Nordic and Baltic regions with Modern Times Group (1997), and in Canada (1997). By 1997, the company had started its AETN International division.
Formerly only direct sales, A&E Home Video initiated a six-month trial in which Barnes & Noble would sell the "Biography" line in stores, which became permanent in 1996. THC debuted in two other media in September 1996 with a radio program on ABC Radio Networks and Border Books stocking THC videos.
The 'Biography' franchise continued to expand with a website in July 1996, a children's version launched in fall 1996, an audiotape line in 1997, telefilm development, a Crown published short biography line and debuted its magazine which replaced A&E Monthly. During the 1998–1999 season, Biography: American Justice and Biography Movies debuted.
History expanded in 1998 into tours of U.S. landmarks with Mayflower Tours having an affiliated website (historytravel.com), History Channel Traveler, and a planned quarterly magazine. While in October, History and MSG Network teamed up to produce several short-form sports history programs.
A+E spun out its two digital cable channels in November 1998 with The Biography Channel and History Channel International from A&E and the History Channel. A&E was spending $10 million per year to convert to the digital format and for digital distribution. With the need to revive a battered channel, improve the brand and create strong content for the A&E channel, A&E executive started the A&E IndieFilms division in 2005.


=== Post-Lifetime acquisition ===
In August 2009, A&E Networks acquired Lifetime Entertainment Services (Lifetime, LMN, and Lifetime Real Women), which at the time was also jointly owned by Disney and Hearst, each with 50% ownership. Following the deal, Disney and Hearst each held approximately 42% of the combined company, while NBCUniversal retained approximately 16%. The deal included mechanisms by which NBCU could choose, or alternatively be forced to, exit the partnership over the subsequent 15 years. In May 2011, A&E Television Networks changed its brand name to A+E Networks. A&E dropped TV as their brands had moved beyond just the TV channel while keeping Networks being contemporary to similar companies.
In July 2012, NBCUniversal confirmed plans to divest its 15.8% stake in A&E Networks by way of a share repurchase by A&E Networks, making Disney and Hearst 50-50 partners in the joint venture. In August 2012, A&E announced that Lionsgate Home Entertainment had acquired the home video distribution rights to its content, replacing New Video.
With an early June 2013 promotion to A&E Networks CEO, Nancy Dubuc launched a new in-house production unit, A&E Studios, and hired veteran BBC executive Jana Bennett to serve as the president of Biography Channel and LMN.
In December 2013, in response to stagnating viewership in comparison to its sister networks, it was announced that the Biography Channel would be re-launched as FYI, a lifestyle-oriented network, in 2014. The channel's new president, Jana Bennett, had previously overseen The Learning Channel's early-2000s transition into a mainstream lifestyle channel.
In August 2014, A&E took a 10% stake in Vice Media for $250 million. The company then announced in April 2015 that H2 would be re-branded into a Vice channel with an indicated early 2016 launch. Director Spike Jonze, Vice's creative director, is overseeing the development of the new 24-hour channel. Disney also made a direct investment in Vice Media with two $200 million investments in November 2015 then a week later in December for about a direct 10% to assist in funding programming. In May 2016, the company signed an international distribution deal with Pulse Films, and its East Entertainment formats and entertainment company.

== Reception ==
Billboard contributor Jeff Benjamin praised "Because I'm The Best", saying "HyunA confidently raps and chants about her swag, making playful remarks about how even her friends are jealous of her because, well, she's the best. Ilhoon [...] drops in to further the claims as the two spit over hard-hitting, synth-heavy hip-hop production with elements recalling recent work from Mike Will Made It and DJ Mustard." Benjamin also highlighted the styling and aesthetic of the track's music video, citing its "tongue-in-cheek presentation" as proof of the opinion that "HyunA is easily one of the baddest females in K-pop."

=== A+ (programming language) ===
A+ is a high-level, interactive, interpreted array programming language designed for numerically intensive applications, especially those found in financial applications.


== History ==
In 1985, Arthur Whitney created the A programming language to replace APL. Other developers at Morgan Stanley extended it to A+, adding a graphical user interface (GUI) and other language features. The GUI A+ was released in 1988.
Arthur Whitney went on to create a proprietary array language named K. Like J, K omits the APL character set. It lacks some of the perceived complexities of A+, such as the existence of statements and two different modes of syntax.


== Features ==
A+ provides an extended set of functions and operators, a graphical user interface with automatic synchronizing of widgets and variables, asynchronous executing of functions associated with variables and events, dynamic loading of user compiled subroutines, and other features. A+ runs on many Unix variants, including Linux. It is free and open source software released under a GNU General Public License. A newer GUI has not yet been ported to all supported platforms.
The A+ language implements the following changes to the APL language:

an A+ function may have up to nine formal parameters
A+ code statements are separated by semicolons, so a single statement may be divided into two or more physical lines
The explicit result of a function or operator is the result of the last statement executed
A+ implements an object called a dependency, which is a global variable (the dependent variable) and an associated definition that is like a function with no arguments. Values can be explicitly set and referenced in exactly the same ways as for a global variable, but they can also be set through the associated definition.
Interactive A+ development is primarily done in the Xemacs editor, through extensions to the editor. Because A+ code uses the original APL symbols, displaying A+ requires a font with those special characters; a font named kapl is provided on the web site for that purpose.

=== A+ (rapper) ===
Andre Levins, also known as A+ (born August 29, 1981, 
Hempstead, New York) is an American rapper. As a teenager he released albums in 1996 and in 1999.

A+ began his music career in 1995, after winning a national talent competition sponsored by Def Jam Records. 
He was the first act signed to Kedar Massenburg's record label, Kedar Entertainment. According to Massenburg, the A+ moniker "means that he's striving for perfection, and he's not really talking about the same things as other young rappers." In 1996, at the age of 14, A+ released his first album, The Latch-Key Child, which featured contributions from Prodigy and Q-Tip. 
"All I See" was chosen as the lead single, and it peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, staying for 14 weeks.
His second album, Hempstead High, was released in February 1999. 
Guest appearances on the album included DeBarge, the Lost Boyz and Canibus. 
The single "Enjoy Yourself", which sampled the 1976 Walter Murphy song "A Fifth of Beethoven", 
reached the top five of the UK Singles Chart, number 63 of the US Hot 100 for three weeks,) and was also commercially successful in Germany and Japan.

=== A,A ===
The A,A is a sculpture by artist Jim Sanborn, located on the campus of the University of Houston, adjacent to the M.D. Anderson Library.
Completed in 2004, it was installed on campus at a reported cost of $240,000. The work of art took the sculptor a year to complete.
The A,A is composed of portions of poems, novels, and prose from a number of different languages from different parts of the world. Some languages included on the art includes Arabic, Russian, Spanish, and Chinese. At night, a built-in light projector casts light through the sculpture. This causes the effect of illuminating the sculpture's text onto the outside of the library's walls.
In addition to the sculpture in front of the M.D. Anderson Library, there are two additions from Sanborn inside the library. These include a 24-foot-long (7.3 m) bronze scroll detailing the history of papermaking that hangs from the ceiling of the first floor and bronze panels along some of the guardrails containing portions of poems and other literature.

=== A, A Novel ===
a, also known as a: A Novel, is a 1968 book by the American artist Andy Warhol published by Grove Press. It is a nearly word-for-word transcription of tapes recorded by Warhol and Ondine over a two-year period in 1965–1967.


== Background ==
a: A Novel  was the second of several publishing projects Andy Warhol produced in his lifetime. Warhol wanted to be a writer but, much like his film work, spontaneous performances and an explicit lack of editing was used as a device. Warhol wanted to write a "bad" novel, "because doing something the wrong way always opens doors". Four typists were employed to transcribe the Warhol/Ondine tapes. Maureen Tucker, the drummer for the Velvet Underground, was an expert typist. However, she refused to transcribe the swear words and left them out. Two high school girls were hired to work on some of the tapes. When one girl's mother heard what they were listening to she threw out the tape, losing several hours of conversation. All four hired typists transcribed the dialogue differently, some identifying the speakers, others not. The editor for a, A Novel, Billy Name, preserved the transcripts as is, with every typo and inconsistent character identification, and even moving from two column pages to single-column based on each typist's style. The final printed version was identical to the typed manuscripts.


== Content ==
a: A Novel, Warhol's knowing response to James Joyce's Ulysses, was intended as an uninterrupted twenty-four hours in the life of Ondine, an actor who was famous mostly as a Factory fixture, Warhol film superstar and devoted amphetamine user. Warhol told the press: "I followed an actor, Ondine, for 24 hours and taped 'everything—everywhere he went ... He talked with a hundred or so people."
A taped conversation between Warhol and Ondine, the book was actually recorded over a few separate days, during a two-year period. The first recording probably took place on Friday, August 13, 1965 (based on a statement on page 17 by Ondine that he was going to see the Beatles the next Wednesday). The book is a verbatim printing of the typed manuscripts and contains every typo, abbreviation and inconsistency that the typists produced from the twenty-four tapes (each chapter is named for its respective tape and side, from "1/ 1" to "24/ 2"). Ondine's monologues and disjointed conversations are further fragmented by Warhol's insistence on maintaining a purity of the transcriptions.


== Cast ==
The book is a roman à clef, meaning that the fictional characters are thinly disguised actual persons. The "cast" is itemized in the glossary written by Victor Bockris in the 1998 paperback edition. A run-down of the major characters in the book are:

Ondine is Robert Olivo, a Warhol superstar.
Drella is Warhol himself (he was nicknamed by Lou Reed as "Drella" because Reed felt it fit both sides of Warhol's persona, being a combination of Cinderella and Dracula).
Steve is Stephen Shore, a photographer who worked with Billy Name.
Paul is Paul Morrissey, who had just joined the group and would eventually become the director of Warhol's later films.
Lucky L is Paul America, newly popular in the Factory crowd for starring in My Hustler.
Gerard Malanga was the star of many Warhol films, and is the only person whose real name is used in the book.
Taxine or "Taxi" is Edie Sedgwick, the great female Warhol superstar. a, A novel was the beginning of the end of their relationship.
Ingrid is Ingrid Superstar, a Warhol Superstar, who was brought to the Factory to "replace" Edie in late 1965.
Rink or "Rink Crawl" is Chuck Wein, responsible for bringing both Edie and Ingrid to the Factory.
Irving Du Ball is Lester Persky, a film producer.
Moxanne is Genevieve Charbon, a French actress who Edie met in Paris that year.
Rotten Rita is Kenneth Rapp, who, with Ondine and Billy Name, made up the "A-heads Trio". Rita was also known as the Mayor, like Ondine was known as the Pope.
The Duchess is Brigid Polk, whose real name was Brigid Berlin. She would be Warhol's companion for the rest of his life, although he did not take part in her only conversation in the book.
Billy Name is Billy Linich, a photographer who worked closely with Stephen Shore. He was also the designer of the Factory.
Do Do or "Do Do Mae Doome" is Dorothy Dean. She worked at The New Yorker in the 60s.
The Sugar Plum Fairy is Joe Campbell, who starred in My Hustler and Nude Restaurant.
Ron Via is Ronnie Vial, a member of the underground.
Oxydol is Olympio Vasconzalez, who starred in Conquest of the Universe with Ondine.
Lou is Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground, whose album cover Warhol created.


== Translations ==
The first and last sections of a: A novel have been translated into Galician by Alberte Pagán.


== Release ==
The book was published by Grove Press in November 1968.
Warhol stated that the title "a" stands for nothing, but his studio manager, Paul Morrissey said it "stands for amphetamine ... the stuff people take. Makes you talk." In his glossary for the 1998 edition of a: A Novel, Victor Bockris cites Billy Name as the source for the title; "a" refers to both amphetamine use and as an homage to e. e. cummings. The title in both editions published by Grove Press in 1969 and 1998 use the a: A Novel format.


== Reception ==
Randy Fields of The Charlotte Observer wrote: "'A' is an experience. It is not a novel. It is more a perverted happening than anything else. ... It's supposed to be exciting; It's dull and boring. The characters are supposed to be way out interesting full of life beautiful people. They're dull and almost pathetic and hopelessly lost in a world they can't face If anything can redeem.
Donald Stanley of the San Francisco Examiner wrote: "A" is outrageous enough to last until Warhol finishes another movie or discovers a next step. Music? In the meantime, his novel has one advantage over the competition: You can start anywhere at random and read forward or leaf backward and it all comes out the same."
John Raymond of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: "a" is very much like Andy Warhol's movies, especially "The Chelsea Girls" ... All very interesting. Well, not all—most of it, in fact, is dull. But the experiment, while maybe not original, is worthwhile."

=== A, A Prime ===
A, A Prime is a Japanese manga anthology of short stories written and illustrated by Moto Hagio. Originally spelled A, A′, it was first published in November 1984 by Shogakukan and brings together three science fiction stories published between 1981 and 1984. In addition to the titular short story which appeared in Akita Shoten's Princess, the anthology includes "4/4 [Quatre-Quarts]" and "X+Y"—both of which were serialized in the Shogakukan magazine Petit Flower. English translations of the stories, which first appeared separately in Viz Media's Manga Vizion from 1995 to 1996, were collected by the publisher in 1997.
The anthology deals with gender, with the androgyny and ambiguity typical of Hagio’s characters, as well as identity and memory. Gender and sexuality are explored most prominently in "X+Y", which features a young man who learns that he is intersex, gender fluidity and transition, and a gay relationship. The story won the 1985 Seiun Best Comic Award, and its English-language version was praised for its artwork and emotion. It is also regarded as having introduced gender-bending to the shōjo manga genre.


== Plot ==
Set in a shared futuristic universe, the stories' common thread is a genetically-engineered "Unicorn" species created for space travel. Extremely intelligent, with a humanoid appearance, they have difficulty understanding other people and their own emotions.


=== "A, A Prime" ===
A research group is attempting to terraform the planet Munzel. Since the mission is dangerous, each member of the group was cloned before departure. The plot revolves around the arrival of the clone of the Unicorn, Adelade Lee. Adelade's clone, with no memory of the three years Adelade lived on Munzel, disturbs Regg Bone, who had a romantic relationship with Adelade. Although he knows she is a clone, the resemblance attracts him and he kisses her to a dispassionate reaction. When Adelade's clone explores the planet Munzel with Regg, they find Adelade's body frozen in a cave. Regg soon asks to be transferred to Space Colony A on the planet Torimann. When Colony A is destroyed in an explosion and Regg dies, Adelade's clone is emotionally shaken; Regg is replaced by his clone, and Adelade's clone weeps when she remembers their kiss.


=== "4/4" ===
On Jupiter's moon Io, Mori, a man with telekinetic powers he cannot control, is training with Professor Mia. After he saves a Unicorn descendant named Trill from a free fall, he frequently visits her in the home of Professor Sazzan, the man who adopted her. When Mori discovers that Sazzan is only interested in his telekinetic powers, he runs away with Trill. Mori kisses Trill, but when she says she loves him and Sazzan equally he overheats and burns Mia's aviary. Mia sends Mori to Mars; Trill's repressed feelings are released, and she expresses her hatred for Sazzan and his experiments. When Sazzan tries to assault Trill she breaks a vase on his head and runs to an airlock, where she falls to her death in front of Mori, who is aboard a ship leaving for Mars.


=== "X+Y" ===
Unicorn Tacto's mother, Marble, committed suicide in his presence when he was seven. His father, Doctor Moonsault, had developed a sex-change drug with an intended temporary effect; however, when Marble took it she remained a woman for three years. Moonsault and Marble married and one month after Tacto's birth, Marble became a man. Marble wanted to be a woman, but he was resistant to the medicine. This, and Moonsault seeing other women, led Marble to commit suicide. Moonsault erased Tacto's memory before leaving on a space mission; Tacto was raised by Doctor George, who brings him to the Allergy Culture Center. Tacto becomes one of its "brains" who develop the Tako Project, Earth's entry in a contest to raise Mars' atmospheric pressure.
On Mars, Tacto meets Mori (from "4/4"). Mori, stunned at the resemblance between Tacto and Trill, falls in love with him. Tacto does not feel the same way and is engaged to Merimé, the cousin of Tako Project member Zazz. This angers Mori, and after their talk, Tacto loses all memory of him. The project requires bringing water from Jupiter, and the group goes to nearby planet Mimas. To regain Tacto's affection, Mori invites him on a scooter tour across Jupiter's rings and they have an accident. Mori, seriously injured, wakes up in an emergency room and goes to search for Tacto who has been missing for 16 hours. He rescues Tacto, they bond emotionally, and Tacto breaks his engagement to Merimé. Moonsault arrives at the request of George's wife, An-An, to help Tacto (who is genetically a woman) decide whether to use female hormones. The doctor explains that Tacto changed his sex frequently, and says that the decision is Tacto's—who remains a man. When his father reveals what happened to Marble, he regains the ability to understand his feelings and knows that he loves Mori.


== Publication ==
A, A Prime, as published in Japanese and English, is a collection of three science fiction short stories: the titular story, "4/4 [Quatre-Quarts]" (Japanese: 4/4カトルカース, Hepburn: Katoru Kāsu) and "X+Y". "A, A Prime" was published in Princess, an Akita Shoten magazine, in August 1981. "4/4" and "X+Y" were published in Shogakukan's Petit Flower—the former in November 1983, and the latter in two parts in July and August 1984. The stories were first compiled and published on November 20, 1984, as the last installment of a Shogakukan series of Moto Hagio's complete works. A tankōbon containing the three stories was republished three times by Shogakukan: on August 30, 1995, as part of the SF Masterpiece Collection, on August 9, 2003, in bunkoban format and on August 25, 2014, in EPUB format.
The English version of the stories appeared in the Viz Media magazine Manga Vizion: "A, A Prime" in April and May 1995, "4/4" in July and August and "X+Y" in four installments from October 1995 to January 1996. Viz Media published the anthology as a graphic novel in October 1997.


== Themes and analysis ==
Shoujo, as a tradition, is defined by this contrast against a prevailing and dominant masculine culture. Its female-ness is incalculable and omnipresent. Rather than taking comfort in the knowledge that this difference exists, Hagio uses her narratives to question its very foundation, specifically, gender. By undermining the reader's sense of gender and applying scrutiny to the interpretive structures related to it, she is calling into question the very conventions that define the work that they are reading.
According to the back cover of the Viz Media edition, the Unicorn's "personal struggles" are a metaphor for human alienation in contemporary society. However, anthropologist Rachel Thorn commented the Unicorns are the "eccentrics", a common feature in Hagio's works. Usually, wrote Thorn, Hagio's stories center "on a remarkable and strange character who [...] seems incapable of so-called 'normal' human interaction" until a "straight man", "unsure of his place in the world, and just trying to muddle through [...] forms a unique bond with the 'eccentric.'" In A, A Prime, Regg Bone and Mori are those straight men.
Although the cover says that "X+Y" discusses gender and sexual identity, Michell Smith of Pop Culture Shock wrote that all three stories explore "themes of gender and identity". Former Viz editor Shaenon K. Garrity said that it "is really about identity in all its forms: sexual identity, gender identity, cloning, lost memories, blocked emotions", and emotional isolation. Manga Bookshelf's Katherine Dacey wrote: "One of [its] most striking themes is the relationship between memory and identity", demonstrated by "A, A Prime" and the character of Tacto.
In the Comics Journal, Rob Vollmar wrote that Hagio gives "4/4" and "X+Y" a shōnen-ai beat and explores gender ambiguity; in "4/4" Mori is depicted as hyper-emotional, and Trill (a woman) has no feelings. Vollmar also highlighted the androgyny of "A, A Prime"'s main characters, noting that Mori and Trill are even more androgynous. In "X+Y", "[The] muted sense of gender identity that is kept to the sub-textual level in '4/4' is transformed into the central conceit ... Hagio effectively scrambles gender awareness until little is left by which to prejudge the dynamic growth of the characters but the result. The resolution of the conflict, then, lies not in whether Mori will overcome his heterosexuality to recognize his biological resonance with the presumably male Tacto, but whether Tacto can remember and thus overcome his childhood experiences in order to accept love from anyone." According to Vollmar, the problems raised by Hagio are not only romantic but "thorny moral and ethical questions". Vollmar wrote that Hagio questions the dichotomy between shōjo and shōnen in her treatment of gender.


== Reception and legacy ==

Although "X+Y" was well received by Japanese critics (winning the 1985 Seiun Award for Best Comic), Michelle Smith called it the weakest of the three stories. According to Smith, Mori and Tacto's relationship is "far too rushed" and Mori's rationale for being in love was unclear. She criticized Mori's causing the accident, and wrote that the subplot about Tacto's chromosomes "[doesn't] make much sense". Smith praised the other two stories and the collection's artistic style, saying that it "doesn't look like anything else". She wrote that the title story alone made A, A Prime worth reading, praising its ending and saying that she would like to see another story with its characters. "4/4" was second best in Smith's opinion, and she enjoyed the portrayal of Trill's lack of emotional involvement. Steve Whitaker, for The Slings & Arrows Comic Guide, called A, A Prime "a masterful example of science fiction in a shojo", praising its art: "Facials and montages are carefully played-off against the portrayal of the various planets and their communities".
Describing the anthology as a "flawless jewel of science fiction", Shaenon K. Garrity called it an emotional work which touched her deeply: "Because of A, A Prime, I discovered that this art form could do more than I'd imagined—not just tell ambitious stories, which I already knew from reading Sandman and Bone and Watchmen, but tell them with passion, in lines drawn from nerve endings, using every weapon in the artist's arsenal to not just dazzle the mind, but stab straight to the heart." Katherine Dacey also praised the "intensely Romantic quality of all three stories" and their artwork, particularly Hagio's representation of the characters' memories and emotional states with "symbolically rich imagery" and a "dream-like quality". Dacey cited Hagio's "unique ability to mix the sublime with the ridiculous", such as the characters' names and costumes and the sex-change drug.
According to Rob Vollmar, A, A Prime is an important part of "the evolution of shoujo out of shonen manga". It was cited by Garrity as "one of the forerunners to countless modern manga with inventive gender-bending elements", such as Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma ½. Another Takahashi work, Urusei Yatsura, has a storyline in which clones are differentiated from the originals by apostrophes on their heads, referring to "A, A Prime"'s title.

=== A, B and C v Ireland ===
A, B and C v Ireland is a landmark 2010 case of the European Court of Human Rights on the right to privacy under Article 8. The court rejected the argument that article 8 conferred a right to abortion, but found that Ireland had violated the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to provide an accessible and effective procedure by which a woman can have established whether she qualifies for a legal abortion under current Irish law.


== Facts ==

Three anonymous women, recorded in the case as "A, B and C" travelled to the United Kingdom to have abortions, because abortions were unlawful in Ireland.: 13–26 


=== A ===
A, thinking her partner was infertile, had become pregnant unintentionally. She was unmarried, unemployed, living in poverty, with an alcohol addiction and had four children, all in foster care and one disabled. At risk of post-natal depression and feeling a fifth child would risk her progress in becoming sober, she borrowed €650 from a money lender at a high-interest rate to pay for travel and a private clinic in the UK, arriving secretly in the UK without telling her family or social workers or missing a contact visit with her children. On the returning train from Dublin she began bleeding profusely, was taken to hospital for a dilation and curettage and suffered pain, nausea and bleeding for weeks thereafter but did not seek further medical advice. After the claim was made to the ECHR, she became pregnant again and gave birth to a fifth child, while struggling with depression. However, she regained custody of two of her children.


=== B ===
B became pregnant after her "morning-after pill" failed. Two different doctors advised there was a risk of an ectopic pregnancy, although she had found it was not. She borrowed a friend's credit card to book flights to the UK. To ensure her family would not find out, she listed nobody as her next of kin once in the UK and travelled alone. The clinic in the UK advised her to tell the Irish doctors she had had a miscarriage. Two weeks after returning to Ireland she began to start passing blood clots, and sought follow-up care in a clinic in Dublin related to the English clinic, rather than attending an ordinary doctor because of her uncertainty of abortion's legality in Ireland.


=== C ===
C had been undergoing chemotherapy for cancer for three years. She had wanted children, but advice from doctors indicated that a foetus could be harmed during any ongoing chemotherapy. The cancer went into remission and she unintentionally became pregnant. While consulting her general practitioner on the impact of the pregnancy on her health and life and tests for cancer on the foetus, she alleged that she received insufficient information due to the chilling effect of the Irish legal framework. She researched the issues on the internet alone. Because she was unsure about the risks, she decided to go to the UK for an abortion. She could not find a clinic for a medical abortion, since she was a non-resident and would need a follow-up, so she needed to wait a further eight weeks for a surgical abortion. The abortion was incompletely performed. She suffered prolonged bleeding and infection, and alleged the doctors provided inadequate medical care, and her general practitioner failed to refer to the fact after subsequent visits that she was no longer visibly pregnant.


=== Irish law ===
Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution of Ireland, as inserted by the Eighth Amendment in 1983, provided that "the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right". This was interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X Case (1992) as permitting abortion only where the continuation of a pregnancy would put a woman's life (not merely health or other interests) at risk. Attorney Julie F. Kay argued on behalf of three women identified as "A, B and C" that the restrictions violated their right to not be subject to degrading and humiliating treatment under article 3, their right to respect for their private lives under article 8, a right to an effective national remedy for these rights under article 13 and equal treatment in relation to Convention rights under article 14. C further alleged her right to life, given the danger resulting from prohibiting abortions, was violated under article 2. The Irish government chose to defend the case, its Attorney General Paul Gallagher, pointing out that Ireland's laws had been endorsed in three referendums. He requested the dismissal of the case because no domestic remedies had been sought by A, B or C and that there was no evidence that they interacted with verifiable legal or medical personnel or institutions in Ireland. The women were supported by a host of pro-choice charities, while various anti-abortion groups intervened to support Ireland.


== Judgment ==
The Court held that "Article 8 cannot ... be interpreted as conferring a right to abortion".: 214  It nevertheless considered that Ireland had violated article 8 with regard to the third applicant, C, because it was uncertain and unclear whether she could have access to abortion in a situation where she believed that her pregnancy was life-threatening. Rather than information being unavailable, the problem was that there was nowhere C could go to secure a legally authoritative determination of what her rights were in her situation.: 267  In this regard it noted the "significant chilling": 254  effect of Irish legislation. All other complaints were dismissed. All of A, B and C's arguments that article 3 (right against inhuman and degrading treatment) as well as C's additional argument that article 2 (right to life) were violated were dismissed as "manifestly ill founded".: 159, 165  The claims of A and B on the basis of article 8 were dismissed, because although it recognised the "serious impact of the impugned restriction on the first and second applicants": 239  and that there was consensus 'amongst a substantial majority of the Contracting States': 235, 112  regarding the legality of abortion, the Court did "not consider that this consensus decisively narrows the broad margin of appreciation of the State.": 236, 237  Thus Ireland had a broad margin of appreciation to maintain its existing laws where they were sufficiently clear.: 241  The Court did not consider it necessary to examine the applicants' complaints separately under Article 14 of the convention.


== Significance ==
Contrary to the hopes or fears of various campaign groups that the case might become a pan-European clone of the US Supreme Court's landmark ruling in the case Roe v Wade, the European Court of Human Rights emphasised there is no straightforward right to an abortion under the convention, and that member states have a broad margin of appreciation to prohibit abortion.: 233–237  However, given the violation of applicant C's right to privacy, the result placed pressure on Ireland to further clarify whether and under which circumstances an abortion may be performed to save the life of a pregnant woman.


== Resolution ==
The Irish government convened an expert group to address the implications of the judgement. The expert group reported to the Department of Health the night before news of the Death of Savita Halappanavar broke.
In 2013, Ireland passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act which the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe found closed the case.

=== A, My Name is Alex ===
"A, My Name Is Alex" is a two-part hour-long very special episode of the NBC television series Family Ties. The episodes aired on March 12, 1987, as an hour-long episode, with the second half-hour broadcast without commercials.
The episode won numerous awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award, a Humanitas Prize and a Writers Guild of America Award for writing as well as a DGA Award. In 1997, TV Guide named this episode on their list of 100 Greatest Episodes.


== Plot ==


=== Part 1 ===
While the rest of the Keaton family grieves over the sudden death of Alex's childhood friend Greg McCormick, Alex himself is acting strangely, gradually being overcome by a volatile mixture of emotions that he futilely tries to hide. We learn that Greg was killed in a car crash while running an errand that Alex had declined to help him with.
After Greg's funeral, Alex begins showing symptoms of survivor guilt, admitting to Mallory that, "My life was saved out of smallness, out of lack of generosity to a friend"; he then says that he should have been in the car with Greg, and then angrily asks himself, "Why am I alive??". Steven and Elyse attempt to comfort Alex, and help him deal with his emotion by getting him professional help.


=== Part 2 ===
Alex is talking with an unseen therapist, who helps him to confront the issues he must now deal with resulting from Greg's untimely death. Through play-acting, Alex revisits his grade school days and situations with his family and attempts to reassess his own life.
When the therapist asks if he believes in God, Alex's analytical side tells him no, but when he expounds on "miraculous things", "phenomena of nature", Alex tells the therapist that he does indeed believe in God, even though he doesn't understand His logic behind allowing Greg to die. Alex begins to accept Greg's death and realizes that he can keep Greg's memory alive by being more like him.
The staging of the entire second part is similar to the classic American play Our Town.

=== A-001 ===
A-001 was the second abort test of the Apollo spacecraft.


== Objectives ==
Mission A-001 was the second in the series of tests conducted to demonstrate that the launch escape system could safely remove the command module under critical abort conditions. Unlike Pad Abort Test 1, in which the launch escape system was ignited at ground level, this mission was flown to demonstrate the capability of the escape system to propel the command module safely away from a launch vehicle while in the high-dynamic-pressure (transonic) region of the Saturn trajectory.
The launch vehicle was the second in the series of Little Joe II vehicles, which had been developed to accomplish early and economical testing of the launch escape system. The Little Joe II was propelled by seven solid-propellant rocket motors - one Algol sustainer motor, which provided thrust for about 42 seconds, and six Recruit motors, which burned out approximately 1.5 seconds after ignition. The spacecraft consisted of a launch escape system and a boilerplate command and service module (BP-12).


== Flight ==
Unacceptable wind conditions had forced a 24-hour postponement of the launch, but the vehicle was successfully launched on May 13, 1964, at 12:59:59.7 UTC (05:59 am MST). A ground commanded abort signal terminated thrust of the launch vehicle (by rupturing the Algol motor casing), ignited the launch escape and pitch control motors, and separated the command module from the service module. Some structural damage was incurred by the command module aft heat shield because of recontact with the booster at thrust termination. At approximately 44 seconds, the tower jettison motor was ignited and satisfactorily separated the launch escape tower from the command module.
The Earth landing sequence was normal until a riser for one of the three main parachutes broke as a result of its rubbing against the structure on the command module upper deck. The parachute separated; however, the command module, supported by the two remaining parachutes, descended at rates of 9.1 to 7.9 metres per second (30 to 26 ft/s) instead of the predicted 7.3 metres per second (24 ft/s) with three parachutes. The command module landed 6.8 kilometres (22,400 ft) downrange at 350.2 seconds after attaining an altitude of 9.075 kilometres (29,772 ft) above mean sea level. Except for the parachute failure, all test objectives were satisfied.

=== A-002 ===
A-002 was the third abort test of the Apollo spacecraft.


== Objectives ==
Mission A-002 was the third in the series of abort tests to demonstrate that the launch system would perform satisfactorily under selected critical abort conditions. The main objective of this mission was to demonstrate the abort capability of the launch escape vehicle in the maximum dynamic pressure region of the Saturn trajectory with conditions approximating the altitude limit at which the Saturn emergency detection system would signal an abort.
The launch vehicle was the third in the Little Joe II series. This vehicle differed from the previous two in that flight controls and instrumentation were incorporated, and the vehicle was powered by two Algol and four Recruit rocket motors. The launch escape system was also changed from previous configurations in that canards (forward control surfaces used to orient and stabilize the escape vehicle in the entry attitude) and a command module boost protective cover were incorporated. The Apollo spacecraft was simulated by a boilerplate command and service module (BP-23). The Earth landing system was modified from the previous configuration by the installation of modified dual-drogue parachutes instead of a single-drogue parachute.


== Flight ==
The A-002 vehicle was launched on December 8, 1964, at 8:00:00 a.m. M.S.T. (15:00:00 UTC) by igniting all launch vehicle motors simultaneously. Conditions at abort initiation were selected from Saturn boost trajectories, and a nominal test point was used for the maximum dynamic pressure region. A pitch up maneuver and the abort were initiated by using a real-time plot of the dynamic pressure versus Mach number. However, an improper constant was used in the meteorological data input to the real-time data system, resulting in the pitch up maneuver being initiated 2.4 seconds early. Although the planned test point was not achieved, the early pitch up caused a higher maximum dynamic pressure than the design value.
Canard deployment took place as expected 11.1 seconds after abort initiation. The launch escape vehicle tumbled four times before stabilizing with the aft heat shield forward. During the first turnaround, the soft portion of the boost protective cover was torn away from the command module. Maximum altitude attained by the launch escape vehicle was 50,360 feet (15,350 m) above mean sea level.
Baro-switches initiated the Earth landing sequence at an altitude of approximately 23,500 feet (7,163 m) above mean sea level. All parachutes deployed properly and the command module, supported by the three main parachutes, descended at the planned rate of about 24 ft/s (7 m/s)  to an Earth landing 32,800 feet (10 km) down range.
The abort conditions obtained were more than adequate in verifying the abort capability in the maximum dynamic pressure region. Only one test objective was not achieved: the boost protective cover was structurally inadequate for the environment experienced during the mission.

BP-23 was refurbished as BP-23A and used for Launch Pad Abort Test 2.  BP-23A is on display as part of the SA-500D Saturn V exhibit at the US Space & Rocket Center, Huntsville, Alabama.

=== A-003 ===
A-003 was the fourth abort test of the Apollo spacecraft. This particular flight is notable because during the abort test flight, an actual abort situation occurred, and further proved the Apollo launch escape system (LES). The CM was successfully pulled away from the malfunctioning Little Joe booster and it landed safely under parachutes.


== Objectives ==
Apollo mission A-003 was the fourth mission to demonstrate the abort capability of the Apollo launch escape system. The purpose of this flight was to demonstrate launch escape vehicle performance at an altitude approximating the upper limit for the canard subsystem.
The launch vehicle was similar to the one used for mission A-002 except that the propulsion system consisted of six Algol motors. The uncrewed flight test vehicle consisted of an Apollo boilerplate command and service module (BP-22) and a launch escape system similar to the one used on the previous mission. The command module Earth landing system configuration was refined to be more nearly like that of the planned production system, and a forward heat shield jettisoning system was provided.


== Flight ==
The test vehicle was launched on May 19, 1965, at 6:01:04 a.m. M.S.T. (13:01:04 UTC). Within 2.5 seconds after lift-off, a launch malfunction caused the vehicle to go out of control. The launch vehicle entered into a roll which caused it to break up before second-stage ignition, and a low-altitude abort was initiated instead of the planned high-altitude abort. The launch escape system canard surfaces deployed and survived the severe environment. The high roll rates (approximately 260 degrees per second at the time of canard deployment) induced by the launch vehicle malfunction stabilized the launch escape vehicle in a tower-forward attitude, which overcame the destabilizing effect of the canards. Post-flight simulations verified the ineffectiveness of the canards at the high roll rate, but showed that canards would be effective at the 20 degree per second roll rate limit of the Saturn emergency detection system.
All spacecraft systems operated satisfactorily. The command module forward heat shield was protected by the hard portion of the boost protective cover and was jettisoned satisfactorily in an apex-forward attitude at low altitude. The soft portion of the boost protective cover remained intact until tower jettison. At tower jettison, part of the cover stayed with the command module for a short time although the rest of the cover moved away with the tower. The hard portion of the boost protective cover remained intact until ground impact. Both drogue parachutes inflated, even under the severe conditions that existed; that is, command module apex forward and rolling. The command module was effectively stabilized and oriented for deployment of the main parachutes.
Because of the early launch vehicle breakup, the desired altitude of 120,000 feet (36.6 km) was not achieved. However, the spacecraft did demonstrate a successful low-altitude abort at 12,400 ft (3.8 km) from a rapidly rolling (approximately 335 degrees per second) launch vehicle. The Mach number, dynamic pressure, and altitude at the time of abort were similar to Saturn IB or Saturn V launch trajectory conditions.

=== A-004 ===
A-004 was the sixth and final test of the Apollo launch escape vehicle and the first flight of a Block I production-type Apollo Command/Service Module.


== Objectives ==
Mission A-004 was uncrewed and was conducted to demonstrate that 

The launch escape vehicle would satisfactorily orient and stabilize itself in the proper attitude after being subjected to a high rate of tumbling during the powered phase of an abort
The escape vehicle would maintain its structural integrity under test conditions in which the command module structure was loaded to the design limit.
The launch vehicle was the fifth and final Little Joe II flown. The propulsion system consisted of four Algol and five Recruit rocket motors. The attitude control system was similar to the one used on mission A-003 except that the reaction control system was deleted and the vehicle was provided with the capability of responding to a radio-transmitted pitch up command. The 
pitch up maneuver was required to help initiate tumbling of the launch vehicle. The spacecraft for this mission consisted of a modified Block I command and service module (Block I production model 002), and a modified Block I launch escape system (airframe 002). The center of gravity and thrust vector were changed to assure that power-on tumbling would be attained after abort initiation. The Earth landing system was essentially the same as that used during Pad Abort Test 2.


== Flight ==
The vehicle was launched on January 20, 1966, at 8:17:01 a.m. MST (15:17:01 UTC) after several postponements due to technical difficulties and adverse weather conditions. The pitch up maneuver was commanded from the ground when telemetry showed that the desired altitude and velocity conditions had been reached. The planned abort was automatically initiated 2.9 seconds later. The launch escape vehicle tumbled immediately after abort initiation. Pitch and yaw rates reached peak values of 160 degrees per second, and roll rates reached a peak of minus 70 degrees per second. The launch escape system canard surfaces deployed at the proper time and stabilized the command module with the aft heat shield forward after the escape vehicle had tumbled about four times. Tower jettison and operation of the Earth landing systems were normal, and the command module landed about 113,620 feet (34.6 km) from the launch pad after having reached a maximum altitude of 78,180 feet (23.8 km) above mean sea level.
All systems performed satisfactorily, and the dynamic loads and structural response values were within the design limits and predicted values. Although a structural loading value of primary interest was not achieved (local differential pressure between the interior and exterior of the command module wall), all test objectives were satisfied.

=== A-050 ===
As of 2015, the A-050 ekranoplan is being developed by the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau, two concepts of which have been shown at the MAKS Air Show. According to ValueWalk, the model "will feature modern avionics and navigation", having a take-off weight of 54 tons and carrying capacity of 9 tons; it will be powered by R-195 booster engines, and have a cruising speed of 400 to 480 km/h (250 to 300 mph), with a range of 4,800 km (3,000 miles). At the same time, it is thought the ground effect vehicle will be armed with cruise missiles.

=== A-0 Geyser ===
A-0 Geyser is a geyser in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park in the United States.
A-0 Geyser is part of the White Creek Group which includes Spindle Geyser and Botryoidal Spring. It can be identified by its shallow, round basin with a round vent in the middle found 100 feet (30 m) southeast of the Surprise Pool parking area.
It erupts for a duration of about 30 to 40 seconds with intervals of 20 to 26 minutes between eruptions. The fountain reaches a height of 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3.0 m).
The name A-0 is an unofficial name based on the proximity of this geyser to the dormant A-1 and A-2 geysers.
The RCN location of this geyser has been unintentionally switched with Dilemma Geyser, elsewhere in the Lower Geyser Basin.

=== A-0 System ===
The A-0 system (Arithmetic Language version 0) was an early compiler related tool developed for electronic computers, written by Grace Murray Hopper in 1951 and 1952 originally for the UNIVAC I. The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.
The A-0 system was followed by the A-1, A-2, A-3 (released as ARITH-MATIC), AT-3 (released as MATH-MATIC), and B-0 (released as FLOW-MATIC).
The A-2 system was developed at the UNIVAC division of Remington Rand in 1953 and released to customers by the end of that year.  Customers were provided the source code for A-2 and invited to send their improvements back to UNIVAC. Thus, A-2 could be considered an example of the result of an early philosophy similar to free and open-source software.

=== A-100 (multiple rocket launcher) ===
The A-100 is a 300 mm (12 in), 10-tube multiple rocket launcher developed by Beijing-based China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT, also known as 1st Space Academy) for the Chinese PLA ground forces. It is a derivative of Weishi Rockets WS-1 with simple cascade terminal inertial guidance.
Although, not active with the Chinese military, the system is active with the Pakistan Army. 


== Overview ==
China reportedly received a small number of the Russian Smerch 9K58 300 mm, 12-tube multiple launch rocket system and its ammunition in 1997. The Smerch 9K58 system is capable of firing a ‘smart’ submunition that has a dual-colour infrared sensors for terminal guidance, which enables the rocket to achieve accuracies previously difficult to achieve with unguided rockets of that range. The submunition is fitted with kinetic energy fragment warheads which are said to be able to penetrate 70mm of armour at an angle of 30° to the normal.
China National Precision Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CPMIEC), a trading company that markets Chinese missile and defence technologies to foreign customers, revealed the A-100 multiple launch rocket system in 2000. The system was developed by CALT, which is famous for its ChangZheng (Long March) family of space launch vehicles and DongFeng family of ballistic missiles. The A-100 system is CALT's first attempt to break into the tactical weapons market. The development of the A-100 possibly began in the late 1990s and the MRL system was observed in service with the PLA 1st Artillery Division in Guangzhou MR in 2002, possibly for trial and evaluations.
Although the system resembles the Russian Smerch 9K58 300 mm rocket system, it is not a copy of the Smerch as previously speculated. The A-100 rocket is fitted with a simple guidance system for greater accuracy.
In 2019, Pakistan admitted that China sold the designs of A-100 system to Pakistan and Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released an official statement regarding the indigenously developed A-100 and commissioned as Multiple Launch Rocket System in its Regiment of Artillery.


== Rocket specifications ==
Rocket calibre: 300mm
Rocket length: 7,300mm
Rocket weight: 840 kg
Warhead: 235 kg, ~500 submunitions
Firing range: 40~100 km
The A-100 fires 300 mm solid propellant rockets, with a firing range of 40~100 km. The A-100 rocket is 7.3m in length, weighs 840 kg, carries a 235 kg warhead, and is stabilised by spin, thrust, and stabilising fins. It is fitted with a warhead containing 500 HE-FRAG (High Explosive Fragmentation) anti-armour/personnel submunitions. The submunition can penetrate 50mm of armour, and has a blast radius of 7m. The submunitions have a spreading radius of 100 +/- 40 metres.
The rocket consists of the warhead and fuse, a thrust stabilising system, a rocket motor and the tail section. The rocket motor is a single chamber, solid rocket motor with an advanced hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) composition rocket propellant. The stabilising fins are folded inside the launch tube and open once the rocket leaves the tube.
The rocket is equipped with an onboard computer to help correct the horizontal and vertical deviations. During the first three seconds of the rocket's flight, the onboard computer detects the horizontal difference between the programmed trajectory and actual status of the rocket, and controls the rocket's stabilising thrust system to correct the rocket's flying direction. The onboard computer corrects the vertical deviation by adjusting the warhead detonation time so that the submunitions are spread with high accuracy.


== Launch vehicle ==
Launch vehicle road speed: 60 km/h
Launch vehicle travelling range: 650 km
Reloading time: 20 minutes
The launch vehicle is based on a Taian TAS4500 8X8 wheeled truck chassis developed by Tai'an Special Vehicle Manufactory. The vehicle weights 21t and has a maximum load of 22t. The vehicle has a maximum road speed of 60 km/h and a maximum range of 650 km. The vehicles has a gradient of 57% and a fording depth of 1.1m. The vehicle is equipped with four hydraulically operated stabilisers which are lowered in preparation for the rocket launch. 10 launcher tubes mounted on the chassis are arranged as two blocks of four (top) and six (bottom) tubes.


== Variants ==


=== A100E ===
Export version


=== A200 ===
Development of A100 with simple cascade inertial terminal guidance updated by GPS.  The arrangement of A200 is different from A100 in that each launching box consists of three rows of launching tubes, three on the top and bottom respectively, and two in the middle.  A200 rockets also have additional forward control surfaces that were not present on A100 rockets.


=== A300 ===
Development of A200 with a range of 290 km and integrated GNSS/INS guidance.


== Operators ==


=== Current operators ===
 Azerbaijan - Azerbaijani Armed Forces - Received six Polonez vehicles from Belarus in 2018.
 Belarus    - Armed Forces of Belarus - Local production of A-200 known as Polonez. Received six A-200 systems from China by 2016.
 Pakistan   - Pakistan Armed Forces - Approximately 60 A-100E vehicles delivered from China by 2015.
 Tanzania   - Tanzania People's Defence Force - 12 A-100 MLRS received from China in 2013.


=== Failed trials ===
 China - People's Liberation Army - The A-100 MRL was trialed by the PLA in 2002, but the PHL03 was selected instead.

=== A-100 class ===
A-100 is the colloquial name given to the introductory/orientation training class for incoming Foreign Service Officers. These courses are taught in the Foreign Service Institute at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center in Arlington, Virginia. The purpose of the class is to provide orientation to the United States Department of State, information on embassy operation and foreign affairs, intelligence collection and dissemination, State Department computer systems, and the roles different categories of personnel perform in the conduct of diplomacy. It is the basic job-orientation course for the United States Foreign Service before diplomats branch off into different career tracks or geographic specialties.


== Training ==
The class ranges from five to six weeks long and typically has between 75 and 100 students. During the first day of the class, students learn about their classmates and give presentations on them. The first week of the class is devoted to security briefings, the issuing of laptops and State Department identification cards, and indoctrination into the more classified aspects of the Foreign Service. The class is an opportunity to learn about the Foreign Service, not a discussion forum for foreign policy; as public servants, Foreign Service Officers, when acting in their official capacity, are obligated to defend publicly and to implement the foreign policy directives and objectives of the federal government of the United States, notwithstanding any personal or political reservations.
Subsequent weeks examine State Department organizational structure, drafting and editing, the organizational structure of an Embassy, public speaking, and protocol. While the majority of the class takes place at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center, there are some field trips to other U.S. government foreign affairs agencies, as well as off site team-building training that lasts for two days and normally takes place at a military base in West Virginia.
Towards the end of the course, students are informed of their first assignments, usually overseas, during the "Flag Day" ceremony, so named because they are presented with a small flag of the country to which they have been assigned. After A-100, additional training is personalized to the individual depending on his or her overseas posting and/or language ability and post requirements.
Members often maintain contact with each other throughout their entire careers, and regard A-100 classmates much like high school or college classmates. A-100 classes are numbered sequentially. The class numbers were restarted with the enactment of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, and several groups have shared numbers over the years.


== History ==
In function, if not name, the A-100 Class dates back to June 7, 1924, when President Coolidge issued Executive Order 4022 establishing a Foreign Service School for the purpose of training newly hired probationary Foreign Service Officers (FSOs).  The Foreign Service School's first class was conducted from April 20 until September 1, 1925, and "graduated" a class of 17.
According to tradition, the "100" in A-100 refers to the number of the room in which the course was first conducted.  The State Department's 1926 Telephone Directory confirms that the Foreign Service School was located in Room 100 of the State, War, and Navy Building.
Additional details can be found in Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs' autobiography: Proud Servant: The Memoirs of a Career Ambassador. Ambassador Briggs recounts his experiences in preparing for the 1925 Foreign Service examination—the written and oral tests that were instituted after the Rogers Act of 1924 established the Foreign Service as "a competitive, nonpolitical, professional career". Ambassador Briggs says that "simultaneously there came into existence in the Department of State, in Room 100 on the ground floor of the old State War Navy Building, a modest enterprise called the Foreign Service School". He goes on to explain that, in order to provide new officers with an initial "home office indoctrination" and avoid the problems that might result if officers' initial training was entirely entrusted to overseas supervisors whose quality and interest level "varied from post to post", it was decided to organize "a course of several months in the State Department before a new officer was sent to his first foreign assignment". Ambassador Briggs concludes that "until after World War II, the Foreign Service School remained an unpretentious institution, concentrating on unraveling consular regulations and language instruction".
With the Foreign Service Act of 1946 a new Foreign Service training program, patterned after programs in the Army and Navy, came into existence.  The newly established Foreign Service Institute (FSI) included a "School of Basic Officer Training" (with classes distinguished by the letter "B" preceding a three-digit course number).  An "A" prefix was used to identify courses administered by the separate "School of Advanced Officer Training".  FSI's 1949 Course Catalog includes "B 100"—a basic training course prescribed for all newly appointed Foreign Service officers.  The separate "A 100" course involved three months of intensive training for Foreign Service officers following the successful conclusion of their probationary years in the field.
By 1955, however, these separate schools had been eliminated.  In the 1955–56 FSI course catalog, the training programs for junior, mid-level, and senior-level officers are all found under the heading of "General Career Training". The B-100 course had vanished, but A-100 survived as the three-month "Junior Foreign Service Officers' Course" which was "required of all newly appointed Foreign Service officers of class 6 before assignment to their first post abroad". By 1963, the course had been retitled "Basic Foreign Service Officer's Course."

=== A-10 Attack! ===
A-10 Attack! is a combat flight simulation video game for the Apple Macintosh computer released by Parsoft Interactive in 1995. The game features an A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft that takes part in a variety of missions in West Germany during a hypothetical limited conventional attack by the Warsaw Pact. A-10 boasted one of the most detailed flight models of any game of its era, a physics model that extended to solid-body interactions with the ground and complete aerodynamics for every object in the game, including ordnance. Macworld rated it "Best Flight Simulator" in a review of Mac simulations.
The game was followed by a sequel named A-10 Cuba!, originally as a stand-alone game on the Mac and  Windows-based PC's, but later re-released on the Mac as a plug-in module for the original game. The Mac OS versions were produced by Parsoft, while the PC version of Cuba was a joint production with Activision. This partnership was renewed for Parsoft's final release, Fighter Squadron: The Screamin' Demons Over Europe.


== History ==
Development of what would evolve into A-10 Attack! started after the release of Hellcats: Missions at Leyte Gulf, an expansion pack for Hellcats Over the Pacific that was released in 1992. Although Hellcats managed to do a lot with limited capabilities of the hardware, the game had a number of clear drawbacks. For one, the missions were written in computer code as part of the game engine, which meant the user could not add new missions or modify the existing ones. Another problem was that the vehicles and other objects in the game were hard-coded with various behaviors, which made them difficult to customize. Even the game map itself existed only in the code.
Parsoft started experimenting with a plug-in system to replace the hard-coded objects in Hellcats. Known as the Virtual Battlefield Environment (VBE), the system still required programming tools to build out the objects, but once they were finished, they could be loaded into the game engine from individual files. Adding these into a game simply required the files to be placed in the appropriate directories in the user's file system. VBE allowed anything to be added in this fashion; aircraft, vehicles, missions and maps.
Another problem with Hellcats was its very simple physics, which simulated only the most basic flight dynamics and resulted in flight that was unrealistic in a number of ways. There were no structural limits either, allowing a number of unrealistic extremely high-g maneuvers. A completely new flight engine was created for the VBE system that simulated subsonic aerodynamics with a fair degree of realism, with effects like dutch roll and adverse yaw "falling out" of the engine without being deliberately coded in. Additionally, the system included a new physics engine that featured simple finite element analysis which allowed damage to be realistically simulated, including its effects on the flight dynamics of the aircraft. The resulting simulation was arguably the most advanced of its era.
All of this was combined with an improved version of the graphics engine developed for Hellcats, allowing players to use multiple monitors and any resolution their machine could support. Hellcats used a  polygon-based flat-shaded system that utilized differential updating to avoid bottlenecks in the computer bus and thereby improve frame rates. A-10 retained the basics from Hellcats, but added the ability for small areas of texture mapping to be applied, which was used on the vehicles to add roundels and squadron markings. A combination of improved code in the engine and the rapid improvement in computer performance since the release of Hellcats allowed the new engine to feature greatly increased scene complexity.
Early versions of the game were shown at MacWorld Boston in the summer of 1993. At the time, the physics and graphics engines were operational, although there was no "game" per-se. The world consisted of a single-runway airbase and a nearby target range with several "bullseye" targets. This was followed some time later by a fairly functional demo version, which took place on a mythical island with a number of friendly and enemy objects in the area.
For the release version, a series of missions in northern Germany were created, along with a new mission-planning map system that was widely lauded. As the game was being finalized for release, Apple introduced the new PowerMac systems. Running in the 68k emulator, the game proved to be very slow, so a delay followed while they wrote a PowerPC "native" version, and the game was finally delivered in 1995, a full three years after starting development and about a year later than promised.
A-10 Cuba! followed, although at first it did not use VBE and was shipped in the form of a stand-alone application. It was only later that Cuba was re-released to run as a VBE module which allowed it to run in the original application. The VBE specifications were never released to 3rd parties, and the few public comments on the topic from Parsoft claimed it was simply not ready and required work to clean it up and document it. By 1997, Parsoft had already moved onto a new project, and it was clear that VBE had been abandoned.


== Description ==

Gameplay in A-10 Attack! switched between a mission map and planning system displayed on a 2D map, and the in-game flying. The switch between the two modes could be made at any time during a game, with the plane turning on the autopilot and following the mission outline when the user was in the map mode.
Flight mode was relatively similar to most flight simulators, although control was normally via mouse or a joystick mapped onto the mouse. The "2" view looked down into the cockpit, showing all the instruments in a layout fairly faithful to the actual layout in the A-10. The mechanical cockpit controls and various displays, including the HUD, were all likewise fairly good simulations of the original.
The game included a unique "active hand" system that allowed the player to manipulate the switches and controls without having to remember keyboard commands. Holding down the option key turned off mouse control of the aircraft, and made a hand-cursor appear that could operate the controls by clicking on them. The cursor changed as it moved over the controls to indicate what could be done, clicking, rotating or "rolling" the mechanical controls. Even complex weapons release modes could be controlled in this way, although doing so often required a series of clicks on different controls.
Weapons included a variety of conventional bombs and their laser-guided counterparts, as well as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and HARM missiles, cluster bombs and rockets. However, the cannon remained one of the most important weapons in the game (because the A-10 was built around the GAU-8A gatling gun). Even without completing the missions, the game engine itself was detailed enough to create a sub-game where users attempted to place their Hogs in odd positions on the map, or use the engine for various other tricks.

In the map mode, any object in the game that was close enough to have become visible to an allied object appeared as a "chit" on the display. Using controls on the chits, the user could move their point of view to those objects, and see what they were doing. At the start of a mission, only friendly or nearby neutral chits would be seen, but as the player flew into the mission, more would become visible as they (or other allied forces) approached them. Additionally, the user could display and control the waypoints for the aircraft in the mission through a dialog-box based editor, customizing their flight plans. Games would typically have the player switch back and forth between flight and the mission map, looking at their progress and perhaps newly spotted targets that were not immediately obvious from the cockpit.
The selection of missions included with the game generally increased in difficulty with a growing number of targets and friendly vehicles. They covered a series of events after a fictional invasion of West Germany by limited Warsaw Pact forces, with the map covering the western Baltic area with Denmark in the upper left. Like Hellcats, the A-10 mission system in VBE allowed the missions to be custom programmed, and some of them included events such as an attempted bombing of a dam. However, as in Hellcats, A-10 did not allow the user to create their own missions.


== Reception ==
Christopher Breen had an extensive review in Computer Gaming World's September 1995 edition. He notes its "extremely fluid" graphics and excellent frame rate, but spends almost half of the article explaining VBE and its future potential. He concludes, "With VBE, A-10 Attack! represents a remarkable first step in a revolutionary Mac-gaming technology. As far as we're concerned, this lowly Hog is a blue-wibbon winner." His only complaints were "occasional crash bugs" and "sadly lacking" manual.
MacUser's Steven Levy briefly reviewed the game as part of a 1995 gaming roundup, awarding it the title of "Best Flight Simulator". He noted its "stunningly realistic" missions and its "gorgeously rendered" landscapes, concluding with a somewhat muted "A-10 Attack is a welcome addition to anyone's virtual battlefield".
Bob LeVitus reviewed the game as part of a flight simulator round-up, which also included Out of the Sun and F/A-18 Hornet. He titles the mini-review "It Soars Above the Rest". However, he complained about the documentation, noting "Its biggest downfall is that its documentation is the weakest of the three flight sims in this review."

=== A-10 Cuba! ===
A-10 Cuba! is a flight simulator computer game developed by Parsoft Interactive and published by Activision in 1996 for Windows and Mac. The game was a sequel to the Mac-exclusive A-10 Attack!. A third game in the series, titled A-10 Gulf!, was slated for release in 1997, but later cancelled.


== Gameplay ==
It features an A-10 Thunderbolt II on a mission to defeat guerrilla forces at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. As in most war flight simulator games, the main objectives consist of defending an airbase, destroying ships, bridges, tanks or buildings and escorting other aircraft.

A-10 Cuba! was the long-awaited sequel to the original A-10 Attack! flight simulator. A-10 Cuba! had the same impressive flight model as its predecessor, but the graphics were much more detailed and thus required a computer with more power. Other improvements included tire smoke when landing or skidding, runway taxi-way lighting, the Air Combat Command insignia on most U.S. aircraft and an increased number of polygons (making objects appear more round than they appeared in A-10 Attack!). Weapon damage was also upgraded and ground vehicle physics were made to be more realistic. However, the Windows version lacked the comprehensive mission editor and map view available in both the Macintosh version and in A-10 Attack!.
A-10 Cuba! has four practice levels, Take off, Landing, Air to Ground, and Air to Air. Each training level takes place in the desert area of the game.


== Reception ==

The game received mixed reviews upon release. Its simple, but high performing graphics were praised while its documentation and features were found lacking. Macworld's Michael Gowan wrote that the game features "the best flight modeling of any Mac flight sim". Although he found the game somewhat inferior to F/A-18 Korea, he summarized that A-10 Cuba! "offers great gameplay, varied missions, and rough-and-tumble network play."

=== A-10 Tank Killer ===
A-10 Tank Killer is a 1989 combat flight simulation video game for DOS developed and published by Dynamix. An Amiga version was released in 1990. The game features an A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft. Following the success of Red Baron, version 1.5 was released in 1991 which included Gulf War missions and improved graphics and sounds. Several mission packs were sold separately. A sequel published by Sierra, Silent Thunder: A-10 Tank Killer II, was released in 1996.


== Gameplay ==

The gameplay consists of the player piloting an A-10 Thunderbolt II "tank killer" through various combat missions set in the Gulf War air campaign as well as a fictional European scenario. The player receives a mission briefing, has the opportunity to customize a weapon load-out before starting the mission, and is debriefed after the mission.


== Reception ==
According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of A-10 Tank Killer and its sequel surpassed 250,000 units by the end of March 1996.
Computer Gaming World stated that "A-10 has much going for it" and gave it four stars out of five. The magazine recommended the game for those looking for quick fun, not "flight grognards" seeking realism. In a 1994 survey of wargames, the magazine gave the title three-plus stars out of five, liking the graphics, but noting the "very sensitive" joystick control. The DOS version of the game received 5 out of 5 stars in Dragon. Due to the violence level of A-10 Tank Killer, it has been placed on the "Index" in Germany and is not generally available to the public.

=== A-11 Football League ===
The A-11 Football League (A11FL) was a proposed professional american football minor league that was announced in 2013 and originally planned on beginning play in 2014 but folded before taking the field. The A11FL planned on playing a spring and summer schedule using modified National Football League rules that allowed for the A-11 offense, a system which potentially allows "All 11" offensive players to be eligible receivers, thus creating a more wide-open game. The A11FL introduced six of its eight planned franchises in April 2013 and announced a seventh proposed team several months later. The franchises were to be distributed in major markets across the United States, with five of the seven teams reviving names of franchises in the United States Football League of the 1980s.
Later in 2013, the A11FL announced its intention to play two televised "showcase games" in the spring of 2014 and delay its first full season until 2015. However, in April 2014, the league announced that it would move its two planned California franchises to as of yet undetermined cities while postponing its showcase games indefinitely, though it still planned to kick off its first season with eight teams in the spring of 2015.
The A11FL unofficially ended in July 2014, when the league made this statement via its Facebook page: "(T)he folks who were involved with the A11FL investment team have been actively working on financing for a new Professional Spring Football League that will no longer be branded as the A11FL... More news as it comes available." Although no further updates were announced, former league officials Kurt Bryan and Scott McKibben were named head coach and team president of the expansion Oakland Panthers of the Indoor Football League in 2019.


== History ==


=== Previous spring football leagues ===
There had been numerous attempts to establish a spring football league in the last forty years, the best-known being the United States Football League (1983–85), the NFL-sponsored WLAF/NFL Europe (1991–92 and 1995–2007); and the XFL (2001). Others include the Professional Spring Football League (PSFL), which folded before playing any games in 1992; the Regional Football League (RFL), which lasted a single season in 1999; the Spring Football League (SFL), which played just four games in 2000; and the Stars Football League, which intended to be a national league but spent most of its three-year existence (2011–13) as a regional semi-pro league based in Florida. (Several other proposed spring leagues never got past the planning stage; for instance, the International Football Federation was set to begin play in 2000, but never made it past their initial press conference.)


=== Development ===


==== A-11 offense ====

California high school football coaches Kurt Bryan and Steve Humphries developed the A-11 offense in the mid-2000s by using a loophole in rules concerning allowable punting formations to design an offensive scheme in which "All 11" players were potentially eligible receivers. While some high school coaches began to adopt the offense, many more felt that it was "unsportsmanlike" and "against the spirit of the rules". In 2009, the loophole which allowed the A-11 to be used was closed by the National Federation of State High School Associations by a 46–2 vote. In 2011, Bryan and Humphries began planning a professional football league that allowed the A-11 offense, which they felt made for a safer and more wide-open game.


==== Introduction and TV deal ====
The creation of the A11FL was announced on April 16, 2013, with a call for investments and business partners. The league was designed to start as single-owner entity in which all franchises were to be owned and operated by the league office.
At press conference on February 6, 2014, A11FL commissioner Scott McKibben announced six of its eight inaugural teams, leaving the final two teams and home stadiums to be announced at a later date. At the same press conference, McKibben announced that the league had reached an agreement with ESPN to broadcast two "showcase games" and the 2015 regular season. The showcase games were scheduled to be played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa in May 2014 and at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas in June 2014.


==== Time out / folding ====
The league announced via Twitter on March 28, 2014, that it would be redirecting efforts towards a "new opportunity" that would "secure the formation of the league for many years". On April 11, 2014, the league announced via Facebook that "things are coming together just as we said in our announcement. No need to read between the lines. Big news ahead." Later that same April, the A11FL canceled its two showcase games and announced that previously introduced franchises in San Francisco and Los Angeles would not be included in the league due to the cost of workers' compensation insurance in California. However, commissioner McKibben stated at the time that the A11FL still planned on fielding eight teams for its inaugural season, which was still planned for the spring of 2015.
On July 9, 2014, the league announced via Facebook that it was dropping the A11FL name and the A-11 offense and would attempt to "rebrand" as a "new league", effectively folding the A11FL. The league released what would have been the logos for the eight originally proposed teams on December 28, 2014, in an effort to promote the graphic design company that had designed the logos. In February 2015, the A11FL announced via Facebook that officials of the league were planning on organizing a different football league not based on the A-11 offense. No further plans or news about the proposed league have been announced since then, though former league officials Kurt Bryan and Scott McKibben were named head coach and team president of the Oakland Panthers (now the Bay Area Panthers), an expansion team in the Indoor Football League.


== Key personnel ==
Fred Walker – Chairman
Scott McKibben – CEO/Commissioner
Mike Keller – President & COO
Kurt Bryan – Founder & Executive VP of League Development
Steve Humphries – Founder
Chris Schuring – CTO


== Clubs ==
The league had announced seven of its eight planned teams before pulling franchises in Los Angeles and Oakland due to California's workers compensation laws. The name and location of the eighth planned franchise had yet to be announced when the league folded. Five of the proposed clubs borrowed names and design elements from franchises in the 1980s United States Football League which would have been a very controversial move, adding the risk of legal copyright owner and logo issues. The Sea Lions and Staggs were the two exceptions, with newly created original names. (The USFL names were later acquired by The Spring League as part of a plan to launch its own USFL revival in 2022.)

=== A-11 offense ===
The A-11 offense is an offensive scheme that has been used in some levels of amateur American football. In this offense, a loophole in the rules governing kicking formations is used to disguise which offensive players would be eligible to receive a pass for any given play. It was designed by Kurt Bryan and Steve Humphries of Piedmont High School in California.
The scheme was used at the high school level for two seasons before the national governing body of high school football, the National Federation of State High School Associations, closed the scrimmage kick loophole in February 2009, effectively banning important facets of the offense. Due to rules regarding player numbering and eligible receivers, the scheme as originally designed is not usable at most levels of football, including the National Football League and college football.
The A-11 offense was to be the basis of the A-11 Football League (A11FL), a professional football league which was scheduled to play its first season in 2015. However, after announcing franchises names and scheduling "showcase games" in early 2014, the A11FL folded before taking the field.


== History ==


=== Development ===
The A-11 offense was developed in 2007 by head coach Kurt Bryan and offensive coordinator Steve Humphries at Piedmont High School in Piedmont, California. Coming off a 5–6 record in 2006, the coaches were looking for an edge to compete against other teams that fielded more top athletes. Bryan and Humphries found a loophole in the rules concerning allowable punt formations, which they used to design an every-down offense in which all 11 (hence the name "A-11") players were potentially eligible to receive a forward pass. Using the A-11, Piedmont's record improved to 7–4 in 2007 and 8–3 in 2008, with the offense often confusing defenses and scoring more points.


=== Controversy, banning, and modifications ===
While some high school coaches noticed Piedmont's success with the A-11 and began incorporating aspects of the offense into their own playbooks, others called the system "an unsporting act" and "outside of the spirit of the rule code". Bryan and Humphries began heavily promoting coaching clinics, instructional DVDs, and other materials soon after completing their first season running the offense, which also drew criticism from other coaches.
High school athletic associations in North Carolina, West Virginia, Louisiana, and the District of Columbia banned the use of the A-11 for the 2008 season. In February 2009, the National Federation of State High School Associations rules committee voted 46–2 to close the loophole allowing the linemen-free formations featured in the A-11. The system's creators petitioned the California Interscholastic Federation to allow use of the offense over the next three seasons on an experimental basis, but the appeal was denied.
The scheme's creators modified the system to comply with the rule changes in 2009. Though the offensive personnel is spread out more than in conventional formations, this version of the A-11 abides by the numbering requirements, making it easier for the defense to determine which players could legally go out for a pass. As such, it is similar to spread schemes from the early days of football such as the Emory & Henry formation. Unlike the original A-11, the modified version is legal in most levels of football.


== Basic concepts ==

The most striking characteristic of the A-11 is its use of a formation in which most offensive players except the center are spread out across the line of scrimmage standing upright. In conventional football formations, five or more offensive players are offensive linemen, who set up before each play in a three-point stance and who serve exclusively as blockers. Offensive linemen almost never carry the football and are almost always ineligible to catch a forward pass or even advance beyond the line of scrimmage before a pass is thrown. At most levels of football, (including the National Football League (NFL), college football, and American high school football), offensive linemen must wear jersey numbers from 50 to 79, marking them as ineligible receivers in all but very limited situations.
In the A-11, however, offensive linemen in the traditional sense are not typically employed. Any player with any jersey number may be stationed anywhere across the line of scrimmage, and depending on their position at the snap, any player may serve as an eligible receiver on any given play. This was possible because, when the A-11 offense was introduced in 2007, a loophole existed in the high school rule books that allowed teams in a "scrimmage kick" (i.e., a punt or field goal) formation to be exempted from numbering requirements. Instead of employing five offensive linemen who are obviously ineligible to receive a pass, teams were allowed to station any player wearing any number anywhere on the field, causing confusion for the defense as they try to determine who might go out for a pass. And since there were no restrictions concerning when the "scrimmage kick" exemption could be used, the A-11 offense could be used on every down.
To use the scrimmage kick formation exemption, the player who receives the snap (presumably the kicker or placeholder) must stand at least seven yards behind the line of scrimmage. The A-11 places the quarterback in that position, which becomes a deep shotgun formation. This has the effect of reducing the need for offensive line protection since defensive players have more ground to cover before reaching the passer. The offense also places an additional passing back (similar to the wildcat offense) in the backfield next to the quarterback, creating the potential for either back to receive the snap, pitch to the other back, run or pass the ball, block, or go out for a pass.
The A-11 complies with the rule that caps the number of eligible receivers during any given play at five (maximum six if the quarterback hands the ball off or laterals to an ineligible receiver who then passes the ball). However, because players in the scrimmage kick formation can make themselves an eligible or ineligible receiver by going in motion or by simply stepping on or off the line of scrimmage, the defense does not know which offensive players will be eligible until just before the snap. This has the effect of confusing defensive personnel, as they must quickly figure out which offensive players to cover and adjust their assignments accordingly. The constantly changing offensive roles coupled with the deep position of the quarterback forced most opposing defenses to play a soft zone pass defense against the A-11, making it difficult to play standard run defense or pressure the quarterback.
In the modified version of the A-11 developed after 2009, the center is flanked by ineligible numbered "anchors", basically creating a 3-man offensive line in the center of the formation. Like any ineligible receiver, the anchors can neither receive forward passes nor advance downfield before a forward pass is thrown across the line of scrimmage, but can catch lateral and backward passes, take handoffs, advance downfield prior to a screen pass to an eligible receiver, recover a short punt behind the line of scrimmage, or even throw the ball if it is handed, punted or pitched backwards to them. Two other players spread out along the line of scrimmage must also wear numbers that automatically make them ineligible, resulting in formations similar to the old swinging gate or Emory & Henry formations. In this version of the A-11, the offensive players who cannot legally go out for a pass are clearly identified before the snap by their uniform numbers, making it easier for the opposing team to set their defense accordingly.


== Legality at various levels ==


=== High school ===
As mentioned, a loophole in the rules regarding punt formations allowed the A-11 to be used at the high school level until 2009, when the National Federation of State High School Associations rules committee closed the loophole. A modified version that complies with uniform numbering regulations can still be used.


=== College football ===
The scrimmage kick formation is allowed on fourth downs under NCAA rules and on conversion attempts, and a few situations which define a scrimmage kick formation with an additional requirement that "it is obvious that a kick may be attempted." It is otherwise not allowed for most normal plays, making the original A-11 impossible to use on an every-down basis.


=== NFL ===
The A-11 as originally designed is not legal in the National Football League (NFL) due to rules concerning the required jersey numbers of players at different positions. Players who play at positions that are usually ineligible to receive a pass must declare themselves as eligible receivers to the referee if they will be lining up at an eligible position in a formation. The referee then announces their eligibility before the play, negating the element of surprise that the A-11 relies on. The league imposed an additional rule to discourage teams from placing players with eligible numbers at an ineligible position (Bill Belichick had used such a strategy during select games in the 2014 season); as of the 2015 season, players with eligible numbers must line up in a position that makes it obvious that they are ineligible. The two-quarterback system is legal under NFL rules but (especially since the decline of the wildcat fad) seldom used, though the New Orleans Saints' success with a two quarterback system involving Taysom Hill and Drew Brees has resulted in a leaguewide increase in two-quarterback formations.


=== CFL ===
The A-11 was also not legal under Canadian football rules. There is no scrimmage kick exemption in the Canadian Football League (CFL). Persons who wish to change position from an eligible to an ineligible receiver (or vice versa) must physically change their uniform to a number that reflects their eligibility, and must seek permission from the official to do so.
Furthermore, until the end of the 2008 season the CFL rule book dictated that a designated quarterback must take all snaps, which made the two-quarterback system used by the A-11 (as well as offenses such as the Wildcat) illegal in the CFL. This rule was removed in CFL, mainly so that the Wildcat formation could be used. However, the A-11 is still unusable.


== A11FL ==

The A-11 Football League (A11FL) was a proposed professional spring outdoor football league that was led in part by A-11 creators Kurt Bryan and Steve Humphries and planned on utilizing the A-11 offense exclusively. The A11FL was scheduled to debut in May 2014 with two nationally televised "Showcase Games" and then kick off its first regular season with eight teams in March 2015. However, the exhibition games and the 2015 season were cancelled in April 2014. Soon after, the A11FL announced on its Facebook page that it was abandoning the idea of using the A-11 offense but that some of its founders would try to establish a different spring football league, though no further developments were announced. In 2019, Bryan was named head coach of the Oakland Panthers indoor football team; in 2024, he accepted a similar position with the Stockton Crusaders.

Notes

=== A-135 anti-ballistic missile system ===
The A-135 (NATO: ABM-4 Gorgon) is a Russian anti-ballistic missile system deployed around Moscow to intercept incoming warheads targeting the city or its surrounding areas. The system was designed in the Soviet Union and entered service in 1995. It is a successor to the previous A-35, and complies with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
The system is operated by the 9th Division of Anti-Missile Defence, part of the Air Defence and Missile Defence Command of the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces.


== History ==
A memo from the archives of Vitalii Kataev, written around 1985, had envisaged that the system "will be completed in 1987 to provide protection from a strike of 1–2 modern and prospective ICBMs and up to 35 Pershing 2-type intermediate-range missiles".
The A-135 system attained "alert" (operational) status on February 17, 1995. It is operational although its 51T6 component was deactivated in February 2007. A newer missile (PRS-1M) is expected to replace it. There is an operational test version of the system at the Sary Shagan test site in Kazakhstan.


=== Testing ===
In November 2017, a successful test of the 53T6 interceptor was carried out. Target speed up to 3 kilometers per second (53T6 speed 3), acceleration overload – 100 G, preload maneuvering – 210 G.


== Structure ==

A-135 consists of the Don-2N battle management radar and two types of ABM missiles. It gets its data from the wider Russian early-warning radar network, that are sent to the command centre which then forwards tracking data to the Don-2N radar. The Don-2N radar is a large battle-management phased array radar with 360° coverage. Tests were undertaken at the prototype Don-2NP in Sary Shagan in 2007 to upgrade its software.
Russian early-warning radar network consists of:

Daryal bistatic active phased array early-warning radars
Dnepr/Dnestr space surveillance early-warning radars
Voronezh phased array early-warning radars
US-KMO, US-K and EKS early-warning satellites
Command, control, communications and intelligence services


=== Deployment ===
There are at least 68 active launchers of short-range 53T6 endoatmospheric interceptor nuclear armed missiles, 12 or 16 missiles each, deployed at five launch sites. These are tested roughly annually at the Sary Shagan test site. In addition, 16 retired launchers of long-range 51T6 exoatmospheric interceptor nuclear armed missiles, 8 missiles each, are located at two launch sites.


== Successor (A-235) ==
The successor system, dubbed 'Samolet-M' (and more recently A-235) will employ a new, conventional, variant of the 53T6 missile to be deployed in the former 51T6 silos. The new PRS-1M is a modernized variant of the PRS-1 (53T6) and can use nuclear or conventional warheads. It can hit targets at ranges of 350 km and altitudes of 50 km.

=== A-13 (tank) ===
The A-13 was a specification of British Cruiser tanks produced by the General Staff Directorate of Tank Design before and during the Second World War.  

The A13 specification was produced prior to the second world war, calling for the development of a new cruiser tank.  This was the first specification of British cruiser tank to be based on the Christie suspension design.
The specification was revised over time, and led to the development of three different vehicles:

A13 Mark I produced the Cruiser Mk III based on the original specification;
A13 Mark II produced the Cruiser Mk IV a revision based on up-armouring of the original specification;
A13 Mark III produced the Covenanter tank based on the final version, a complete reworking of the specification.

=== A-1 (SP-1370) ===
A-1 (SP-1370) was a converted houseboat used by the United States Navy during World War I. She was assigned the section patrol craft number SP-1370.
The A-1 was built in 1911 by Sillit Buchanan. Early in the war, the houseboat was inspected for possible naval service, and was taken over from F. E. Wright of San Pedro, California on 6 October 1917. The vessel was placed into service for the Navy on 30 December 1917. She operated in the waters of southern California through the end of World War I. Her logs end on 9 December 1918. So far no record of the boat's subsequent fate has survived.

=== A-1 (autovía) ===
The A-1 (also informally known as Autovía del Norte; Basque: Iparraldeko Autobia) is a Spanish autovía route which starts in Madrid and ends in Irun. It replaced the former national road from Madrid to France, the N-1 road. It carries the designation of European route E05, and, as one of the major north–south arteries of Spain, is one of the country's busiest highways.
Between Burgos and Armiñón there is a toll alternative for this autovía, the autopista AP-1.
In 2011, work was ongoing to bring the section between Burgos and Madrid up to modern standards.


== Sections ==
Autovía A-1 currently has two sections: one between Madrid and Burgos and another between Miranda de Ebro and Alsasua. Traffic through the 49.6 km discontinuity between Burgos and Miranda de Ebro is redirected to the N-I. Beyond Altsasu, traffic continues on the N-I to the French border.

=== A-1 (code) ===
A-1 was the designation for a code used by the United States Navy during World War I that replaced the Secret Code of 1887, SIGCODE and another system designed for radio communication. The cryptographic system was developed by Lt. W.W. Smith in the Office of Naval Operations by randomly associating key words with 5 letter patterns.

=== A-1 (nuclear reactor) ===
The A-1 nuclear reactor was the first Soviet plutonium production reactor, built and operated at the Mayak Production Association from 1948 for the Soviet atomic bomb project. It was affectionately named "Annushka" by project scientists. 


== Design ==
It was designed as a light water-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor (LWGR), with an initial power level of 100 MWt (megawatts thermal). Its design and purpose were similar to the B Reactor, the first industrial-scale US plutonium production reactor. The Soviet nuclear program had extensive espionage on the Manhattan Project, and program chief Lavrentiy Beria pushed for direct replication of Manhattan designs at every step. Due to concerns that the Mayak facility was in range of US Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, the reactor was to be sheltered underground in a pit, similar to F-1. Unlike the US B reactor, which used horizontal loading of uranium and irradiation slugs, Soviet scientists successfully pushed for a vertical design. This became the forerunner of the RBMK design.


== Construction ==
The uranium and graphite material used in the reactor underwent purity testing at the F-1 nuclear reactor. It was composed of 1050 tons of graphite, and 120 to 130 tons of natural uranium.  


== Operation ==
Lead Soviet nuclear physicist Igor Kurchatov brought the reactor to criticality on 8 June 1948. It began operation on 19 June 1948. Plutonium metal was first separated from its spent fuel on 16 April 1949. It was the only source of plutonium for the first Soviet nuclear test, RDS-1, on 29 August 1949. 
It was the second-ever nuclear reactor in the USSR, and represented many of their firsts, including first large-scale and first water-cooled.
During its operation, it suffered many issues leading to shutdown and repairs. These included corrosion of the aluminium channel liners and fuel element cladding, swelling and breakage of uranium rods, their fusing into the graphite, and leakage of cooling water into the graphite core. In January 1949, a full reassembly was attempted to salvage the reactor. Uranium slugs were removed after five months of operation, at temperatures over 100 °C (212 °F). It was not known at the time they also gave off radiation doses in the megacurie range. There was also exposure to gasseous fission products. Workers handled irradiated materials, sometimes directly, and suffered injuries including burns, amputations, and radiation sickness. Kurchatov himself received hazardous doses, which very likely contributed to his health decline in 1950, stroke in 1954, and death in 1960 at age 57.

=== A-1 (wrestler) ===
Alastair Charles Ralphs (born May 22, 1977) is a Canadian professional wrestler and former bodybuilder, better known by his ring name, A-1 (alternatively spelled A1 or A-One). He is best known for his appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), from 2004 to 2007, as part of Team Canada.

== Professional wrestling career ==


=== Border City Wrestling (2001–2005) ===
Alastair Ralphs was trained by Scott D'Amore in the Can-Am Wrestling School, and debuted in D'Amore's Border City Wrestling promotion in 2001. After spending three years as an undercard talent, Ralphs became A-1, a cocky, arrogant heel, forming an alliance with Johnny Swinger. He defeated D'Lo Brown for the BCW Heavyweight Championship on December 12, 2004, in Belleville, Michigan at "A Night of Appreciation for Sabu".
On January 23, 2005, at New Year's Revolution, Ralphs interrupted the Hall of Fame induction ceremony, complaining that he was being overshadowed by older wrestlers. Scott D'Amore responded with a jibe aimed at Ralph's previous career as a bodybuilder, leading to a brawl between Ralphs and D'Amore. Following a distraction from Jade, A-1 was able to powerbomb D'Amore through a table. Ralphs went on to retain the heavyweight title in a match with Abyss, using Abyss's own chain to knock him unconscious.
Ralphs lost the BCW Heavyweight Championship to Bobby Roode on July 22, 2005. In the course of his reign as champion he faced well-known veterans such as Jim Neidhart and King Kong Bundy.

=== A-1 Club ===
A-1 Club was a gas station and coffee shop originally and then in 1948 expanded to include a casino. This was located in West Wendover, Nevada.


== History ==
The A-1 Club (casino operations) opened in 1948 and closed in 1967. 
In the earlier years of the A-1, it basically functioned as the mess hall for Wendover Army Air Field when the air field was not in full training mode and the on-base mess hall was not available.
According to one reference, it was owned by a man named Twain West. However, in another article about casinos of West Wendover, the man's name is Fred West. The casino was bought out by the wife of Casino owner William "Bill" Smith who owned the Stateline Casino. The wife's name was Anna Smith, and she then renamed the A-1 Club to Jim's Casino and continued to run the business. In 1972 - Jim’s Casino took the place of the A-1 Casino.

=== A-1 Comics ===
A-1 Comics is a Golden Age comics publication that began in 1944 and ended in 1955, lasting 139 issues. Only the first 17 issues carried the title "A-1" on the cover. Issues #18 and up used the feature as the book title with different numbering. A-1 and its numbering continued to be used in the indicia. The series was used by owner Vincent Sullivan's Magazine Enterprises to try out a number of potential characters and titles, as well as reprinting newspaper strips such as Texas Slim, Kerry Drake and Teena. Several original A-1 titles succeeded and were given their own titles, including Tim Holt and The Ghost Rider. Issues were devoted to Thun'da, Cave Girl, and Strongman. Title that didn't do well included Dick Powell Adventurer, Fibber McGee and Molly, and Jimmy Durante Comics. The final issue was devoted to Bob Powell's Strongman.


== List of A-1 Comics and features ==
A-1 Comics was published at an irregular frequency. Issues would carry their own unique numbering, series titles, and frequencies in addition to the A-1 title and numbering. Some would continue titles and numbering from series that Magazine Enterprises had previously canceled.

A-1 Pictures, Inc. (Japanese: 株式会社A-1 Pictures, Hepburn: Kabushiki-gaisha Ē-wan Pikuchāzu) is a Japanese production company founded by ex-Sunrise producer Mikihiro Iwata. It is a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment Japan's anime production firm Aniplex.


== History ==
The company was established by SMEJ's animation production division, Aniplex, on May 9, 2005, to animate its anime series and productions. In 2006, it co-produced the original production Zenmai Zamurai, and in October of the same year, established a studio in Asagaya. In the following year, 2007, the studio produced its first series, Ōkiku Furikabutte.
Originally established to oversee the production of only a few of Aniplex's family-oriented series, the studio has since grown and expanded as a full-fledged studio involved in the production of a wide range of media and anime productions and other activities, which it has overseen. The studio has also expanded its international presence, participating in the noted international convention, Anime Expo 2007 (AX 2007), held in Long Beach, California, and having its own panel there.
In 2010, A-1 Pictures worked in collaboration with a joint project of TV Tokyo's anime department and Aniplex called Anime no Chikara for the creation of original anime series. Three anime series were produced that year for the project: Sound of the Sky, Night Raid 1931 and Occult Academy.
In April 2018, A-1 Pictures rebranded its Kōenji Studio as CloverWorks, giving it a unique brand identity, which made it distinguishable from its main Asagaya Studio. On October 1, 2018, CloverWorks separated from A-1 Pictures, although it still remains as a subsidiary under Aniplex.
On June 17, 2024, the studio 3Hz announced that its animation planning and production business was transferred to A-1 Pictures.

=== A-1 Yola (Esham album) ===
A-1 Yola is the tenth solo studio album by American rapper and record producer Esham. It was released on April 19, 2005 through Psychopathic Records, marking the artist's second and final studio album for the label. Recording sessions took place at the Lotus Pod in Detroit. Production was handled by Esham himself, except for two songs produced by Polar Bear and Marc Live. Physical copies of the album were released together with a DVD containing Esham-directed music videos for the majority of its songs.
The album debuted at number 176 on the Billboard 200, number 48 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, number 12 on the Independent Albums and number 6 on the Heatseekers Albums in the United States.


== Lyrics and music ==
AllMusic reviewer wrote: "during the course of A-1 Yola, Esham takes the form of street hustler, kingpin, vampire, and all sorts of underworld characters, injecting his undiluted personality into each three-to-four-minute sketch. His sonic backdrop remains raw but fresh, drawing an impressive amount of energy out of sparse beats". According to Esham, he was sent receipts from fans who claimed that the album's bass-heavy sound blew out subwoofers, fried amplifiers and shattered rear windshields.


== Music videos ==
The album came with a bonus DVD which contained music videos for almost all of the album's songs, excluding "Enemies", "Gangsta Dedication" and "?". The video for "Justa Hustler" was reissued on the 2007 Psychopathic Records' DVD Psychopathic: The Videos.

=== A-1 holin family ===
The Actinobacterial 1 TMS Holin (A-1 Holin) Family (TC# 1.E.32) consists of proteins found in actinobacteria, their conjugative plasmids and their phage. They are usually between 90 and 140 amino acyl residues (aas) in length and exhibit 1 or sometimes even 2 transmembrane segments despite the families name (i.e., TC# 1.E.32.2.1). Although some are annotated as phage proteins or holins, members of the A-1 family are not yet functionally characterized. A representative list of proteins belonging to the A-1 Holin family can be found in the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB).

The sturdy airborne lifeboat was to be carried by a heavy bomber specially modified to handle the external load of the lifeboat. The A-1 lifeboat was intended to be dropped by parachute during Dumbo missions to land within reach of the survivors of an accident on the ocean, specifically airmen survivors of an emergency water landing.


== Design ==
The first airborne lifeboat was designed in the United Kingdom by Uffa Fox in 1943 and used from February 1943. In the United States, Andrew Higgins evaluated the Fox boat and found it too weak to survive mishap in emergency operations. In November 1943, Higgins assigned engineers from his company to make a sturdier version with two air-cooled engines. Higgins Industries, known for making landing craft (LCVP) and PT boats, produced the A-1 lifeboat, a 3,300-pound (1,500 kg), 27-foot (8 m) airborne lifeboat made of laminated mahogany with 20 waterproof internal compartments so that it would not sink if swamped or overturned. Intended to be dropped by modified Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, it was ready for production in early 1944.
The yellow-painted vessel was supplied with enough food, water and clothing for 12 survivors to last for about 20 days in the ocean. It was provided with sails kept relatively small so that inexpert operators could use them. A "Gibson Girl" survival radio was aboard with an antenna to be lifted up with a kite. Its two engines propelled the boat at 8 miles per hour (13 km/h); if just one were used the speed was 5 miles per hour (8 km/h). The effective cruising range was about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) with some 100 to 150 miles (160 to 240 km) made per day.
Higgins also produced a smaller 18-foot (5.5 m) version of the A-1 for the US Coast Guard that could be dropped by PBY Catalinas. This version was half the weight of the A-1. Unlike the larger version for the USAAF, the smaller Higgins air dropped lifeboat was designed to rescue only eight or fewer persons. While a November 1945 Popular Mechanics article states it was in USCG service there are few public references to this smaller version of the A-1.


== Operations ==
The Higgins A-1 lifeboat was to be dropped by an SB-17 traveling at an airspeed of 120 miles per hour (190 km/h) and an altitude of about 1,500 feet (500 m). Precisely as the aircraft passed directly over the rescue target the boat was to be released. The boat dropped free for a short distance, then static lines attached to the aircraft's bomb bay catwalk drew taut, pulling out three 48-foot (15 m) parachutes of a standard U.S. Army design. Under the open parachutes, the boat took on a 50° bow-downward angle and descended at a rate of 27 feet per second (8 m/s), or about 18 miles per hour (29 km/h). In a manner similar to Fox's airborne lifeboat, upon contact with seawater, rocket-projected lines were automatically sent out 200 yards (180 m) to each side to make it easier for survivors to reach the Higgins lifeboat. The parachutes settled into the water to create a sea anchor holding the boat steady while survivors worked to reach it. Inside the boat, the crew of the aircraft that dropped the lifeboat would have placed a map giving the approximate position of the boat and a recommended compass setting to take in order to facilitate rescue.
The first Higgins airborne lifeboat used in an emergency was dropped on March 31, 1945, in the North Sea, some 8 miles (13 km) offshore of the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog. In the evening of March 30, a PBY Catalina landed in six-foot (2 m) swells to save the pilot of a downed P-51 Mustang, but one of the Catalina's engines lost its oil in the process, rendering the flying boat unable to take off. Darkness, distance, and poor visibility prevented the Catalina men from making contact with the Mustang pilot who drifted in a raft and was eventually taken prisoner of war. The next morning, a Vickers Warwick located the Catalina and dropped a Fox-designed airborne lifeboat nearby, but after being retrieved the lifeboat began to break up from repeatedly smashing against the Catalina in the increasingly heavy seas.

Instead, the six aircrew lashed three of their own inflatable rubber dinghies together and abandoned the aircraft in ten-foot (3 m) swells. Another Warwick dropped another Fox airborne lifeboat some distance away, but its parachute didn't open and it was destroyed upon striking the water. An SB-17 flying in the 35-mile-per-hour (56 km/h), 40 °F (4 °C) breeze dropped its load—Higgins Airborne Lifeboat No. 25—from an altitude of 1,200 feet (370 m) to land about 100 feet (30 m) from the men. As it hit the water, one of the lifeboat's tethering rocket lines snaked out over the junction of two of the dinghies, making an ideal shot. The six airmen transferred to the Higgins lifeboat where they huddled down and waited for three days in the worst North Sea storm of 1945 before two more Fox airborne boats were dropped with gasoline and supplies on April 3, the lifeboats either swamping or breaking up upon hitting the water. On April 4 in continuing rough seas, the airmen were picked up by two Rescue Motor Launch (RML) boats, and the Higgins A-1 lifeboat, unable to be towed, was intentionally sunk by gunfire.
In the last eight months of World War II, Dumbo operations complemented simultaneous United States Army Air Forces heavy bombing operations against Japanese targets. On any one large-scale bombing mission carried out by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, at least three submarines were posted along the air route, and Dumbo aircraft sent to patrol the distant waters where they searched the water's surface and listened for emergency radio transmissions from distressed aircraft. At the final bombing mission on August 14, 1945, 9 land-based Dumbos and 21 flying boats covered a surface and sub-surface force of 14 submarines and 5 rescue ships.


=== Coast Guard ===
The United States Coast Guard (USCG) operated Dumbo flights along the West Coast in the early 1950s, using the PB-1G, a B-17 variant. Such a flight is depicted briefly in the 1954 film The High and the Mighty. Further Dumbo flights were conducted jointly by the USCG and the U.S. Navy during the Korean War.
The A-1 lifeboat was joined and then succeeded by the A-3 lifeboat from 1947. The A-3 lifeboat was used until the mid-1950s, after which winch equipped helicopters had become commonplace enough to be used to lift survivors instead of dropping a lifeboat to them.

=== A-1 motorway (Montenegro) ===
The A-1 motorway, called Princess Xenia motorway (Montenegrin: Auto-put Princeza Ksenija), named after the Princess Xenia of Montenegro, first female driver in Balkans, is a motorway in Montenegro. This motorway is also known as the Bar-Boljare motorway (Montenegrin: Auto-put Bar — Boljare). In 2022, the first part of the motorway was open for public traffic, from Smokovac near Podgorica to Mateševo near Kolašin.
It is part of the larger international project between Montenegro and Serbia that connects to the Belgrade–Bar motorway in Serbia. The motorway will connect Belgrade with Podgorica and the harbour city of Bar, Montenegro's main seaport. 
Italy, Montenegro and Serbia are lobbying to list the route as one of the Pan-European corridors, and it is frequently referred to as part of proposed Corridor XI, or 4B - an envisioned ferry/motorway corridor linking Bari, Bar, Belgrade and Bucharest.
The road's construction began on May 11, 2015 and the first 41km section opened on July 20, 2022 at a cost of $1 billion USD. The project cost was significantly higher than expected, partially due to payment being made in US dollars and thus subject to currency fluctuations. Other commonly cited reasons for the higher cost include the addition of a turnpike, delays in construction, local corruption, and Chinese lending practices under the Belt and Road Initiative. 


== Route description ==
The motorway is to be built in three phases:

(Bar) Đurmani - Sozina tunnel - Virpazar - Bistrica - Šteke - Ćafa - Tološko polje - (Podgorica) Smokovac - this is the southernmost section of the motorway, that will link the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica with the main Montenegrin seaport in Bar. Potential investors, such as EBRD and EIB, were suggesting that this section should be built first, as it will likely have the biggest traffic volume following completion. The planned length of this section is 49 km.
(Podgorica) Smokovac - Bioče - Pelev Brijeg - Lijeva Rijeka - Veruša - Mateševo - this middle section of the motorway has been started first, because of its significance as a link between Podgorica and northern Montenegro. The current road link (E65 and E80), carved into the Morača canyon, is a curvy mountainous road, which is very dangerous during the winter, and is a bottleneck in Montenego's road network. Thus, building this section first is a requirement in bidding documents presented by the Montenegrin government. This section will have a length of 41 km, and is by far the most expensive section of the motorway, with a cost per kilometer estimated at over 20 million EUR.
Mateševo - Andrijevica - Berane - Crnča - Boljare - Border with Serbia - this northernmost section of the motorway is likely to be completed only after progress is made on the Serbian section of the motorway south of Požega. The planned length of this section is 75 km.


== History ==
In October 2008 the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism proposed a Detailed Zoning Plan of the Bar-Boljare Motorway. Before this, a small part of the first section was already built. On July 13, 2005, Montenegro's national day, the Sozina tunnel was opened. Together with the associated road north of the tunnel, it will eventually become a part of the motorway, after a second parallel road and tunnel is built.
The middle section of the motorway was made a priority by the government of Montenegro, and it was decided that this section would be built first. Tenders were invited to build this section. The bids were reviewed in March 2009, and the top bid came from the Croatian consortium, led by the Konstruktor company. Contracts were signed and the beginning of construction works was announced in June 2009. The official copening ceremony took place on October 15, 2009, in the village of Gornje Mrke north of Podgorica, attended by the then Prime Ministers of Montenegro (Milo Đukanović), Serbia (Mirko Cvetković) and Croatia (Jadranka Kosor). However the Croatian consortium failed to provide necessary bank guarantees on time, so the contract was cancelled eight months later.
The second best rated bidder, a consortium of the Greek company Aktor and the Israeli company Shikun & Binui was called in for negotiations by the government. After negotiations, it was agreed that Aktor/HCH consortium would build the two southern sections of the motorway for a price of 1.575 billion euro. The third and the northernmost section, from Mateševo to Boljare (border with Serbia), as well as the small strip across Lake Skadar, were to be the subject of further negotiations. However, the Greek-Israeli consortium also failed to provide bank guarantees, so the negotiations between the consortium and the government of Montenegro were ended in December 2010.
The Government of Montenegro began to explore financing options for motorway construction, including  negotiations with Chinese investors. The possibility of China Road and Bridge Group and China Poly Group Corporation building the road, with the financial backing of Exim Bank of China, was explored. In January 2011, the Montenegrin Minister of Transport sent an official letter of invitation to the Poly Group.
In April 2013 discussions were still under way between the Montenegrin government and Chinese parties and an offer of US$1bn of financing by EXIM bank and the selection of a preferred construction consortium was announced in July 2013.
In December 2014 negotiations with Chinese partners successfully concluded.
In May 2015 work started on the first section in Montenegro, Smokovac-Uvač-Mateševo, expected to finish within 48 months.


== Status ==
The section between Smokovac near Podgorica and Mateševo near Kolašin is finished, and it is Montenegro's first full motorway section. Initially, construction was expected to be finished in May 2019. Later this was revised, and it has been opened in July 2022.
The pillars of the Moračica bridge, the tallest bridge on the motorway, were finished in October 2017. The right tube of Klopot Tunnel is the first tunnel that was excavated on motorway on August 25, 2017. In 2017, tunnels Jabučki Krš (1370 m and 1430 m), Mrke (829 m and 800 m) and Vilac (815 m and 950 m) were also excavated.
In 2018, tunnels Mrki Krš (700 m each tube), Mala Trava (1900 m and 1884 m), Suka (600 m each tube) and Vežešnik (2474 m and 2414 m) were excavated. Longest tunnel in middle section of motorway, Vjeternik Tunnel (3039 m and 2852 m) was excavated on July 9, 2018.

=== A-222 Bereg (artillery system) ===
The A-222 Bereg (Russian: Берег; "Coast") is a Russian 130 mm self-propelled coastal artillery gun, which was developed in the 1980s (entering service in 1988) and was first shown to the public in 1993 at an arms fair in Abu Dhabi.
In 2024, it was reported that this system would participate in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, supporting the "Dnieper River Flotilla".
In 2025 Russia has reportedly upgraded the system to the A-222M variant, which includes replacing the 130mm gun with its 152mm counterpart, it is said to be able to use the Krasnopol ammunition, doubling its range to 50 km. The vehicles in this variant are said to have been delivered to the Pacific Fleet (Russia).


== Description ==
The Bereg artillery system consists of one command and control vehicle (CPU), a combat support vehicle (MOBD) and up to six weapon systems (SAU). All of them are mounted on 8×8 wheeled trucks. The heavily modified AK-130 variant gun is mounted on a wheeled MAZ-543 8×8 vehicle and was designed to engage surface ships and fast attack boats as well as ground targets. It is capable of engaging targets within 1–2 minutes and can fire up to 12 shots per minute.


== Operators ==
As of 2003, the only operator of the system was the 40th BRAP at the Russian Navy base in Novorossiysk, part of the Black Sea Fleet. Later the operator was probably the 11 OBRAB.

=== A-230 ===
A-230 is an organophosphate nerve agent. It was developed in the Soviet Union under the FOLIANT program and is one of the group of compounds referred to as Novichok agents that were revealed by Vil Mirzayanov. A-230 is possibly the most potent nerve agent for which specific toxicity figures have been published, with a human lethal dose estimated to be less than 0.1 mg. However it was felt to be less suitable for weaponisation than other agents such as A-232 and A-234, due to issues with the liquid agent exhibiting low volatility and solidifying at low temperatures, as well as poor stability in the presence of water.


== Legal status ==
A-230 has been added to Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention as of June 2020, and it has been explicitly named as an example compound for schedule 1.A.13. For chemicals listed in Schedule 1, the most stringent declaration and verification measures are in place combined with far-reaching limits and bans on production and use. It is notable to say that Annex 1 does not explicitly relate this structure to the name A-230, just add this particular structure to the prohibited compounds section.

=== A-232 ===
A-232 is an organophosphate nerve agent. It was developed in the Soviet Union under the FOLIANT program and is one of the group of compounds referred to as Novichok agents that were revealed by Vil Mirzayanov. A-232 is reportedly slightly less potent as a nerve agent compared to some of the other compounds in the series such as A-230 and A-234, having similar potency to the older nerve agent VR. However it proved to be the most versatile agent as it was chemically stable and remained a volatile liquid over a wide temperature range, making it able to be used in standard chemical munitions without requiring special delivery mechanisms to be developed.


== Legal status ==
A-232 has been added to Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention as of June 2020, and it has been explicitly named as an example compound for schedule 1.A.14. For chemicals listed in Schedule 1, the most stringent declaration and verification measures are in place combined with far-reaching limits and bans on production and use. It is notable to say that Annex 1 does not explicitly relate this structure to the name A-232, just add this particular structure to the prohibited compounds section.

=== A-234 (nerve agent) ===
A-234 is an organophosphate nerve agent. It was developed in the Soviet Union under the FOLIANT program and is one of the group of compounds referred to as Novichok agents that were revealed by Vil Mirzayanov. In March 2018, the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, claimed to have been informed by British authorities that A-234 had been identified as the agent used in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Vladimir Uglev, one of the inventors of the Novichok series of compounds, said he was "99 percent sure that it was A-234" in relation to the 2018 Amesbury poisonings, noting its unusually high persistence in the environment.
According to a classified report by the United States Army National Ground Intelligence Center, the agent designated as A-232 and its ethyl analog A-234, developed under the FOLIANT program, were "as toxic as VX, as resistant to treatment as soman, and more difficult to detect and easier to manufacture than VX".
No certain data on toxicity exist but it is estimated that the median lethal concentration of A-234 is 7 mg/m3. This means that half of 70 kg individuals under slight physical activity – breathing 15 litres of air per minute – would die within two minutes of exposure. This equates to a median lethal dose of 0.2 mg via respiration.


== Regulated chemical under the Chemical Weapons Convention ==
As of 7 June 2020, A-234 has been added to Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention and it has been explicitly named as an example compound for schedule 1.A.14. For chemicals listed in Schedule 1, the most stringent declaration and verification measures are in place combined with far-reaching limits and bans on production and use. It is notable to say that Annex 1 does not explicitly relate this structure to the name A-234, instead adding this particular structure to the prohibited compounds section.


== Alternative structure ==

An alternative structure for A-234 and the related Novichok agents had previously been proposed by Western chemical weapons experts such as Steven Hoenig and D. Hank Ellison. These structures were supported by Soviet literature of the time and were tested as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, however Mirzayanov explained that a number of weaker agents developed as part of the Foliant program were published in the open literature as organophosphate pesticides, in order to disguise the secret nerve agent program as legitimate pesticide research.
However, the presence of a carbonimidic chloride fluoride group and a dimethylchloroethyl group suggest that this molecule is a member of the C-series of organophosphate agents (C01), with additional mustard and (chlorofluoro-)phosgene oxime radicals, added to produce skin and lung toxicity as well as blistering effects.

=== A-235 anti-ballistic missile system ===
System A-235 PL-19 Nudol (Russian: Система А-235 / ПЛ-19-181М / Нудоль) is a Russian hypersonic anti-ballistic missile and anti-satellite weapon system in development. It is designed to deflect a nuclear attack on Moscow and other regions within European Russia. The main developer of the system is JSC Concern VKO Almaz-Antey. The new system should replace the current one — A-135. The two main differences will be that the A-235 will use conventional warheads and it will be road-mobile.
According to reports in early 2018, the system will not be equipped with nuclear warheads. According to Russian sources, the system will be deployed at points surrounding Moscow by the end of 2018.
The new PRS-1M (45T6) is a modernized variant of the PRS-1 (53T6 Gazelle) and can use nuclear or conventional warheads. It can hit targets at ranges of 350 km and altitudes of 50 km.
The long-range missiles will most likely be equipped with nuclear warheads, while the others will have kinetic energy warheads. Testing of new missiles for the A-235 Samolyot-M system began in August 2014.


== Design ==
Initially, the A-235 missile defense system was planned to have three echelons: long-range echelon with a missile based on the A-925, the medium-range echelon was the updated 58R6 firing complex, and the short-range flight were the PRS-1M missiles (the result of the upgrade of the PRS-1 missiles).


== Tests ==
On 4 June 2019, the Russian Ministry of Defense posted a video showing the successful interception of the test target which was a test of a new anti-ballistic missile system in the form of a long-range surface to air missile. Though the nature of the air defense system which was being tested was not mentioned it has been widely speculated to have been a test of the S-500 Prometheus long-range surface to air missile system which entered early production earlier in the year. However, it also could have been a test of the A-235 anti-ballistic missile system for which tests have been conducted on since 2014.
The anti-ballistic missile system was tested at Plesetsk Cosmodrome, on 15 April 2020, at the ex-launch site of the Tsyklon-2 rocket.
On 15 November 2021, the missile successfully destroyed the Kosmos 1408 satellite. The breakdown of the satellite caused space debris to form, which forced the crew of ISS to shelter. The debris passed every 93 minutes.
The latest test was conducted on 2 December 2022.
"Russia's latest S-550 missile systems will serve as a mobile follow-up of the A-135 'Amur' - A-235 'Nudol' strategic missile defense system.".

A-242 is an organophosphate nerve agent. It was developed in the Soviet Union under the FOLIANT program and is one of the group of compounds referred to as Novichok agents that were revealed by Vil Mirzayanov. Mirzayanov gives little specific information about A-242, stating that it is highly toxic but no figures are given to compare it to other related agents. It is reportedly a solid rather than a volatile liquid as with most nerve agents, and in order to weaponise it successfully, it had to be milled into a fine powder form that could be dispersed as a dust.

== Legal status ==
A-262 is not specifically listed in the Annex on Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention, and falls outside the general definitions covering other Novichok agents, even though it has a chemical structure similar to that of both A-232 (the example compound for schedule 1.A.14) and A-242 (the example compound for schedule 1.A.15). It would however be considered a "Toxic Chemical" under the catch-all provisions due to its potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor activity and potential military applications, but the level of control it is subject to is lower than that for compounds specifically listed under Schedule 1.

=== A-2 (Michigan county highway) ===
A-2 is a county-designated highway in the US state of Michigan running about 42 miles (68 km) along the shores of Lake Michigan in the southwestern part of the Lower Peninsula. The county highway starts near the town of Lake Michigan Beach in Berrien County at an intersection with M-63 and follows Blue Star Highway through rural coastal areas. Running roughly parallel to its modern freeway replacement, Interstate 196 (I-196), A-2 passes through the cities of South Haven and Saugatuck before ending at an interchange with Business Loop Interstate 196/US Highway 31 (BL I-196/US 31) in Holland.
In the early part of the 20th century, what is now Blue Star Highway was part of two auto trails before becoming a state trunkline highway. In 1926, it was designated as a part of US 31 and kept that status until I-196 bypassed the roadway in the early 1960s. Two local business owners spurred the efforts to get the older highway restored to the state highway map in 1970, and the A-2 designation was created as a result.


== Route description ==
A-2 starts at an intersection with M-63 about 1,000 feet (300 m) west of the I-196/US 31 freeway in Lake Michigan Beach. From this intersection, the county highway runs northward through forest between Lake Michigan and the freeway in northern Berrien County. A-2 crosses into Van Buren County about a mile (1.6 km) later and continues winding north-northeasterly. At various locations, local roads connect the county road to interchanges with the freeway as the two run roughly parallel together. Blue Star Highway passes the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station near Covert before coming into the southern edge of South Haven.
In South Haven, A-2 bypasses downtown, rounding the district to the south and east. The county road intersects BL I-196 at Le Grange Street due south of downtown and M-43 a block later. In this area, Blue Star Highway is bounded by a mix of mostly commercial and some residential properties. On the north side of the city, A-2 intersects BL I-196 a second time at Phoenix Street and then continues due north out of town, crossing the Black River. The landscape transitions over to a rural forest area with residential properties as A-2 continues across the county line into Allegan County and passes the South Haven Country Club and some vineyards.

A-2 turns northeasterly near Glenn and crosses over I-196/US 31 to run east of the freeway. Blue Star Highway here follows 68th Street in the county road grid through the community of  Ganges. North of the community, A-2 intersects M-89 about 1,400 feet (430 m) east of its terminus at I-196/US 31. North of here, the freeway turns to the northeast and crosses under A-2. Blue Star Highway continues due north into Douglas. In the city, the county road is bounded by businesses as it S-curves northeasterly to cross a narrow spot of Kalamazoo Lake (part of the Kalamazoo River) into Saugatuck. A-2 bypasses downtown Saugatuck to its east and continues north and northeasterly out of town. The county road crosses over the freeway again and out to farmlands before turning north along 58th Street, well inland of I-196/US 31.
From here, A-2 runs due north and crosses I-196 one last time near the south side of the West Michigan Regional Airport; this crossing has no interchange. The county road passes under the west end of the airport's runway in a tunnel as it meanders along South Washington Avenue to an interchange with BL I-196/US 31 on the south side of the city of Holland where it terminates. South Washington Street continues northward into downtown without the county highway designation. As a county-designated highway, the 41.6-mile (66.9 km) length of A-2 is maintained by the Berrien, Van Buren, and Allegan county road commissions (BCRC, VBCRC, ACRC) in their respective counties.


== History ==
When auto trails were being developed in the early 20th century, the path of the modern A-2 was used for part of two. The first in 1912 was the West Michigan Pike, which ran from the Indiana state line north to the Straits of Mackinac along Lake Michigan. The second was the Western Mainline of the Dixie Highway in 1915. The state legislature created the State Trunkline Highway System on  May 13, 1913, and in the legislation, Division 5 corresponded to a highway along the western Lower Peninsula near Lake Michigan. Six years later, the system was signposted for the  first time, and the original M-11 ran along the former Division 5. In November 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the United States Numbered Highway System, and the state designated US 31 in Michigan along M-11. During World War II, the state highway department bypassed downtown South Haven, shifting US 31 out of downtown. US 31 was given the Blue Star Highway designation on October 10, 1948.
US 31 between the Benton Harbor and Holland areas was slated to become an Interstate Highway when that system debuted in the late 1950s. The first freeway segment in the area opened in 1962 northward from I-94 to near the Berrien–Van Buren county line, and an additional 35 miles (56 km) opened the next year from the northern end of the freeway near the county line to Holland as I-196; US 31 was removed from Blue Star Highway to run along the new freeway.
Blue Star Highway was returned to county control, the US 31 highway signs were taken down, and the roadway was removed from the state highway maps with the completion of the freeway in the area. The owners of a motel in Saugatuck, Mr. and Mrs. Howard "Gene" Temple, received a large number of cancellations because travelers could not find their business. Mrs. Temple said that signage in the area was misleading, and she contacted local officials to get better highway signage for the road. These meetings resulted in a test program for the 1970 state highway map that marked Blue Star Highway as A-2; the Allegan County Road Commission spent $2,000 (equivalent to $12,100 in 2023) to erect about 50 markers along the road in their county. At the time, the scheme was labeled "experimental". Later that year, the system was expanded in scope to the rest of the state. Mrs. Temple was credited as the first Michigan woman to secure a highway designation from the State Highway Commission.
The next year in 1971, A-2 was extended south to the junction with US 33 (now M-63) in Lake Michigan Beach. In 1972, BL I-196 in South Haven was realigned and no longer overlapped A-2. The South Washington Avenue section of A-2 on the south side of Holland was realigned in 2004 into a 885-foot-long (270 m) tunnel to make way for an expansion of the runway at Tulip City Airport (now West Michigan Regional Airport). A roundabout was added at the intersection with North Shore Drive north of South Haven in 2010.

=== A-2 jacket ===
The Type A-2 leather flight jacket is an American military flight jacket closely associated with World War II U.S. Army Air Forces pilots, navigators and bombardiers, who often decorated their jackets with squadron patches and elaborate artwork painted on the back.


== History ==
The A-1 Specification, using illustrative Drawing Number AN-6501, became Standard issue on 7-Nov-1927, but the chrome-tanned sheepskin A-1 was found not to be durable. The A-1 became Limited Standard, meaning replacements were available [the A-2], but the A-1 was available for use until cancelled on 29-Sep-1944 when existing A-1 stock had been exhausted. Following the A-1, the Type A-2 flying jacket was adopted as standard issue by the U.S. Army Air Corps as the successor to the Type A-1 flying jacket on May 9, 1931, per specification number 94-3040 using illustrative Drawing 30-1415.

The A-2 Specification lists the garment as "Jackets, Flying, Type A-2". It describes the jacket's construction as "seal brown horsehide leather, knitted wristlets and waistband (skirt)".  
All contracts used a cotton lining. Cowhide was approved for use in July 1940, beginning with Aero W535-AC-16160, and goatskin was added in March 1941, beginning with Rough Wear W535-AC-18091. All three leathers were chrome tanned per the three different leather specifications and any could be used after being approved for use.
Broadly similar in construction to the A-1, it replaced the A-1's buttoned front and pocket flaps with a zipper and hidden snap fasteners (although the first three A-2 contracts retained the pocket buttons). The A-1's stand-up knitted collar, which buttoned closed, was supplanted in the A-2 by a shirt-style leather collar, with hidden snaps at the points and a hook-and-eye latch at the throat. Stitched-down shoulder straps were also added to the design. Sizes were listed as ranging in even numbers from 32 through 54.
The A-2 was replaced by the AN6552 (AN-J-3) per an Authority for Change of Status Equipment document dated May 24, 1943, and declared "Limited Standard", meaning replacements were available in addition to the A-2. The April 1944 USAAF catalog for ordering supplies does not list the AN-J-3 as an option, but both the A-1 and A-2 are listed (the A-1 for $4.00 and the A-2 for $8.12). The lack of AN-J-3 or updated AN-J-3A replacements may explain why three significant U.S. A-2 contracts were granted in Dec. 1943, or after the A-2 jacket was officially superseded. A-2 flying jackets were also purchased from Simpsons Gloves Pty. Ltd., Vic., Australia by the Department of the U.S. Army in 1942 and 1943. These "V505" jackets have been shown to be used by some members of the U.S. Fifth Air Force.) It wasn't until 26-Feb-1951 the A-2 specification was canceled and replaced by the MIL-J-6251 “Jacket Flying, Intermediate, Type B-15C”. The timing helped make the A-2 into a very popular 1950's surplus jacket for another generation.


== Manufacturers ==
There were many manufacturers of A-2 jackets during the 1930s and 1940s whose product showed a wide range of quality, workmanship, and fit characteristics. All contracts used a cotton lining, though various replacements were made over the years. The first three (3) contracts had button pocket flaps, while all the rest were snapped pockets beginning with Werber order number 33-1729. Manufacturers included civilian clothing producers such as David D. Doniger & Co., makers of the popular MacGregor brand outerwear, as well as leather-goods companies like J.A. Dubow Mfg., whose chief peacetime product was baseball mitts. Rough Wear manufactured the A-2 under several different contracts, each varying slightly in color and style.
Since Mr Eastman's 2012 A-2 reference book, five more A-2 contracts have been found: The Rough Wear 42-1671P by John Chapman of Good Wear Leather Coat Co. fame, the 1943 V505 by Vintage Leather Jacket (VLJ) member dinomartino1 noted above, and the Goldsmith 31-1897, Werber 32-6225, and 1942 V505 all by VLJ member 33-1729.


== Modern Air Force A-2 ==
With the exception of a very brief period from 1979 to early 1981 the U.S. Navy never stopped issuing its G-1 leather flying jackets to Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard flight crews. This meant that an entire generation of Air Force pilots and flight crews had missed out on an opportunity not lost to their Naval comrades. Years of effort by U.S. Air Force personnel to get the A-2 jacket reissued finally succeeded when the Air Force began issuing them again in 1988, a decision that may have been influenced by the popularity of the film "Top Gun", and the military apparel it popularized. The first Air Force A-2 contract was awarded to Avirex, but all subsequent contracts from 1988 to 1998 were awarded to Neil Cooper USA, now U.S. Wings of Ohio. The modern Air Force A-2 is authorized for wear by Air Force aircrews and missileers who have completed their mission qualifications.

=== A-35 anti-ballistic missile system ===
The A-35 anti-ballistic missile system was a Soviet military anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system deployed around Moscow to intercept enemy ballistic missiles targeting the city or its surrounding areas. The A-35 was the only Soviet ABM system allowed under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In development as of the 1960s and in operation from June 1972 until the 1990s, it featured the nuclear-armed A350 exoatmospheric interceptor missile. The A-35 was supported by two Dunay radars (NATO reporting names: Cat House and Dog House) and the Soviet early warning system. It was followed by the A-135 in the early 1990s.


== System A ==
The first Soviet anti-ballistic missile system was System A, which began development at Sary Shagan's Test Range A in July 1956, followed by testing starting in 1959. System A used the V-1000 missile to intercept enemy missiles. First launch of the V-1000 took place on 11 October 1957; its first successful intercept occurred on 4 March 1961, when it intercepted an R-12 missile launched from the Kapustin Yar site.
System A used the Dunay-2 radar designed by V Sosulnikov at NII-37 (which later became NIIDAR), in addition to three homing radars and an RSV-PR ABM radar (NATO: Hen Nest). The three homing radars (called RTN; NATO name Hen Egg)) were situated in an equilateral triangle with a length of 150 kilometres (93 mi). The system could track missiles from a distance of about 700 kilometres (430 mi). The V-1000 launcher and the ABM radar were located together. The system used an M-40 computer which could perform 40,000 operations per second.


== A-35 ==

Work on the A-35 system first started in 1959 with a test model called Aldan. The system's designer was Gregory Kisunko of Soviet Experimental Design Bureau OKB-30. A new missile, called the A-350, was to be designed by P. Grushin of OKB-2. Unlike the V-1000, the missile was to have a nuclear warhead. The design of the system called for it to be able to intercept several hostile incoming missiles simultaneously with a single warhead. It was also to intercept them outside the atmosphere. The A-35 was to have a main command centre, eight early warning radars with overlapping sectors, and 32 battle stations.
Installation work on the A-35 began in 1965, but by 1967 only the test version at Sary Shagan was ready. Awareness of the system's flaws, including its inability to handle MIRVs, was part of the reason a 1967 Ministry of Defence commission decided against fully implementing the A-35. Its eight radars were reduced to the two on which construction had already started: Dunay-3 at Akulovo (Kubinka), also known by the NATO reporting name Dog House, and Dunay-3U at Chekhov (NATO name Cat House).
In 1971, a version of the A-35 was tested with the main command centre, one radar and three battle stations. The command centre was located at the same site as the Dunay-3 radar. In 1974, a version was tested with the main command (equipped with a 5E92 computer) and four of the eight battle stations. Each battle station had two tracking radars, two battle management radars and sixteen A-350 missiles.
Only four of the eight battle stations were ever completed. Each battle station had two areas with eight missiles each. Each area had three radars, which were called TRY ADD by NATO.


== A-35M ==
Testing of the A35-M system began in 1977. It was a slightly modified version, using A-350R instead of A-350Zh missiles.
In 1971, work started on the next generation of ABM systems: the A135. Building of the Don-2N radar started in 1978, and the replacement system was placed on combat duty in 1995.
A 1985 note from the archives of Vitalii Kataev states that the A-35M system was capable of intercepting "a single ballistic missile from some directions and up to 6 Pershing II-type missiles from the FRG".

=== A-3 lifeboat ===
The A-3 lifeboat was an airborne lifeboat developed by the EDO Corporation in 1947 for the United States Air Force (USAF) as a successor to the Higgins Industries A-1 lifeboat. The A-3 lifeboat was a key element of "Dumbo" rescue flights of the 1950s.


== Specifications ==

EDO built the lifeboat of aluminum alloy to be carried by the SB-29 Super Dumbo performing air-sea rescue duties during the Korean War. Approximately 100 of these lifeboats were built—their serial numbers began at 501 and continued in sequence.
The A-3 lifeboat was 30.05 feet (9.16 m) long and it weighed 2,736 pounds (1,241 kg) when fully loaded and ready for attachment to the aircraft. The A-3 lifeboat could rescue 15 people. It was powered by a four-cylinder four-stroke Meteor 20 gasoline engine made by the Red Wing Motor Company. With an Ailsa Craig propeller it was expected to give a speed of 8 knots (9.2 mph) under calm water conditions. Nearly 100 US gallons (380 L) of fuel were on board. The airborne lifeboat was dropped from the SB-29 on a single 100-foot (30 m) parachute. Like previous airborne lifeboat designs, it was self-righting. The boat had a boarding ladder, and carried food and water for the rescued people.
In March 1951, Time magazine reported that the USAF was testing a radio controlled steering device for the A-3 lifeboat. After the boat dropped into the sea, a radio operator aboard the rescue aircraft would start the lifeboat's engine remotely, then direct the boat toward the survivors to make it easier for them to reach. After climbing aboard, the survivors could talk to the circling aircraft by two-way radio. A gyrocompass aboard the lifeboat would be set toward the nearest safe land, and the supply of fuel would allow for 800 miles (1,300 km) of range, with further range possible if additional water, food and fuel supplies were dropped along the way. The USAF expected all their A-3 lifeboats to be equipped with radio control by early 1952.


== World War II and Korean War ==
After World War II, sixteen Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers were converted to carry the lifeboat and assigned rescue duty on a rotating basis, designated SB-29 in a role called "Super Dumbo". The first SB-29s were received by the Air Rescue Service in February 1947. They served in the Korean War where A-3 lifeboats were carried by Super Dumbos over the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan.
From the beginning of the Korean War, the A-3 lifeboat was kept shackled underneath an SB-29 waiting in constant readiness on the ground at each rescue airbase. Inside of the aircraft, however rainwater could enter the boat and pool within an open end of the deployment parachute's bag. After one air drop which failed because of water that had frozen at high altitude, trapping the parachute, the A-3 lifeboat was stored disconnected from the aircraft and with a rain cover in place.
Later in the Korean War, the USAF worked on improving the A-3 with a butterfly fin to stabilize the boat till the parachute opened, a full cover, enabling the drop aircraft to start the lifeboat's motor and steer it to the location of persons in the water, and other improvements. Whether any of these improved A-3s were built beyond the prototype and saw active use is unknown.

Lifeboat number 603 has been restored by the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.
Lifeboat SN Unknown is displayed at the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona.

In animal tests it improved cognitive performance in rats to a similar extent as methylphenidate, but without producing place preference or other signs of abuse liability. Also unlike other dopamine agonists, selective D4 agonists do not cause side effects such as sedation and nausea, and so might have advantages over older dopamine agonist drugs.

A-68930 is a synthetic compound that acts as a selective dopamine receptor D1 agonist. It is orally active and has antidepressant and anorectic effects in animals, producing wakefulness and tachycardia, but without stimulant effects, instead producing sedation. The difference in effects between A-68930 and other D1 agonists such as SKF-82958 may be due to their differing effects on the related D5 receptor.

=== A-7 (transceiver) ===
The Soviet A-7 VHF radio transceiver (later models include the A-7a and A-7b) was developed during World War II and used for communication in rifle brigades and regiments. The complete station was designed to be transported by an individual soldier.


== Design and features ==


=== A-7 ===
The A-7 is a portable man-pack, radio transceiver with narrow-band frequency modulation. The set can be used as a radio telephone in a wired network and managed remotely. Setting the frequency of the receiver and transmitter circuits is adjusted in tandem by one control handle. The antenna and buffer oscillator circuits are common for the receiving and transmitting circuits.
The receiver section is a superheterodyne design with a single frequency conversion, consisting of 8 identical 2K2M valves. A regenerative detector with adjustable feedback is used. The transmitter section includes a 2K2M modulator valve, a CO-257 buffer amplifier valve, and a CO-257 power amplifier valve. Switching from reception to transmission is achieved by switching the power from the heater circuits of the receiver and transmitter valves, alternately.
The transceiver with power supplies and accessories is housed in a wooden box with shoulder straps for carrying as a backpack. For long distances, the set is carried by two soldiers. The set only requires one radio operator. The deployment time is typically not more than five minutes.

Frequency range: 27-32 MHz.
Number of frequency channels: 101.
Transmitter output power: 1W.
Sensitivity of the receiver: 1-1.5 μV.
Intermediate frequency: 1100 kHz.
Antennas: a whip with a height of 2.5 m or a flexible wire 6.4 m long.
Range of action:
On rough terrain - up to 7–8 km.
On urban conditions - 3–4 km.
On slightly cross-country terrain outside of buildings - 10 km and more.
Power source: two dry anode batteries BAS-80 with a total voltage of 160 V and two 2 NKN-10 nickel-cadmium batteries. The time of continuous operation from one set is 35–40 hours.
Dimensions of the transceiver (without protruding parts): 285 × 135 × 165 mm.
Dimensions of the packing box: 210 × 385 × 330 mm.
Mass of the radio station: 15.5 kg, the battery weighs 6 kg.


=== A-7a ===
A-7a is a simplified version of the A-7. The total number of valves was reduced to 9. In the transmitter section, the functions of the modulator and power amplifier were combined into one valve, and in the receiver section one valve was used to simultaneously perform the functions of a high-frequency and low-frequency amplifier (the so-called reflex circuit). The ability to work by telegraph was removed. Energy consumption was decreased by about 30%, other main characteristics were not changed. The A-7a set was manufactured by various factories in several different variants: with and without a tone button, with one or two measuring instruments, etc.


=== A-7b ===

A-7b is a ten-valve version introduced in 1945. In the transmitter section two output valves are used in parallel. The transmitting range was increased by around 50%. The frequency range is 24-28 MHz. There is no feedback adjustment in the detector circuit.
The A-7b was also manufactured from 1950 to 1956 in Pardubice, Czechoslovakia by the Tesla company.

=== A-834,735 ===
A-834,735 is a drug developed by Abbott Laboratories that acts as a potent cannabinoid receptor full agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with a Ki of 12 nM at CB1 and 0.21 nM at CB2. Replacing the aromatic 3-benzoyl or 3-naphthoyl group found in most indole derived cannabinoids with the 3-tetramethylcyclopropylmethanone group of A-834,735 and related compounds imparts significant selectivity for CB2, with most compounds from this group found to be highly selective CB2 agonists with little affinity for CB1. However, low nanomolar CB1 binding affinity is retained with certain heterocyclic 1-position substituents such as (N-methylpiperidin-2-yl)methyl (cf. AM-1220, AM-1248), or the (tetrahydropyran-4-yl)methyl substituent of A-834,735, resulting in compounds that still show significant affinity and efficacy at both receptors despite being CB2 selective overall.

=== A-836,339 ===
A-836,339 is a drug developed by Abbott Laboratories that acts as a potent cannabinoid receptor full agonist. It is selective for CB2, with Ki values of 0.64 nM at CB2 vs 270 nM at the psychoactive CB1 receptor, but while it exhibits selective analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperalgesic effects at low doses, its high efficacy at both targets results in typical cannabis-like effects appearing at higher doses, despite its low binding affinity for CB1.

=== A-90 Orlyonok ===
The A-90 Orlyonok (Russian: Орлёнок, lit. 'eaglet') is a Soviet ekranoplan that was designed by Rostislav Evgenievich Alexeyev of the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau.
The A-90 uses ground effect to fly a few meters above the surface. The Russians classify it as Ekranoplan Class B – it can achieve an altitude of 3,000 m (9,800 ft), placing it between Class A – which is limited to ground effect, and Class C, which exploits the ground effect only during take-offs and landings and otherwise functions as a typical airplane.


== History ==
The Soviet Navy command of the 1960s was very interested in a fast military transport capable of carrying a large payload. The Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau was one of the organizations working on this top-secret project, about which little was known until the fall of the Soviet Union.
Chief Designer R. E. Alexeyev designed several prototypes in the 1960s. At the start of the 1970s, Alexeyev designed a medium-sized ekranoplan to be used as a military transport. The new vehicle was named "Orlyonok" ("Eaglet"). The first flying unit (S-21) was initially tested on the Volga River in the autumn of 1972, and the next year dismantled and transported to the Caspian Sea for continued testing. In 1975 the S-21 crashed during testing, later proved to be due to a deficiency in the alloy used for the hull. A different alloy was used in all subsequent units built.


== Development and design ==
The Orlyonok was designed as a transport and a beach assault vehicle. Unlike other Soviet Ekranoplan designs, the Orlyonok was amphibious and was equipped with wheels for beaching and land based takeoffs.
Orlyonok's development was preceded by the SM-6; a prototype ekranoplan which had the same module layout as the Orlyonok. Experience gained from the SM-6 was used in the development of the Orlyonok. The SM-6 was on display in Kaspiysk for an unknown period. It was later brought back to Kaspiysk naval base and supposedly scrapped sometime between 2006 and 2008.
The layout of the engines on the Orlyonok was unusual and a testament of the special needs of such an unconventional aircraft. Mounted in the top of the tail, it featured a massive Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprop, the most powerful turboprop ever made, which provided cruise power. The nose of the aircraft mounted two turbofan engines with the intakes on top of the nose and the exhaust along the side of the fuselage, the thrust of these engines being vectored under the wings to produce PAR thrust (increased lift and extra propulsion) for takeoff. Under cruise conditions and in ground effect, the front engines could be shut off since their power was unnecessary to keep the aircraft aloft; this also minimized intake of water, salt and low flying birds.
Both takeoff and landing were assisted with large span-length flaps that greatly increased lift and could capture PAR thrust for increased air pressure. Water landings were assisted with a hydro-ski that extended out of the belly of the craft below the main wings.
The front end of the Orlyonok was hinged behind the radome and the whole assembly could open sideways to speed disembarkation of the infantry it carried, or of a BTR armoured personnel carrier. The Orlyonok had a built in folding ramp that allowed it to load and unload vehicles with no external support.
There were plans to resume production of the Orlyonok. The craft were to have been built in Petrozavodsk.


== Production ==
Overall only four units were built:

1 non-flying unit for static testing, scrapped.
S-21 completed in 1972, damaged in 1975, rebuilt as S-23 in 1977, then lost again in 1992 (the craft was then destroyed as the Russian Navy would not afford the cost for retrieval by salvage companies).
S-25 completed in 1979, retired 1993, scrapped around the year 2000.
S-26 completed in 1980, retired 1993, on display at the Museum of the Navy, Moscow.

=== A-91 ===
The A-91 is a Russian bullpup assault rifle developed by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau during the 1990s. It is an evolution of the earlier 9A-91 carbine, primarily designed to be compact, reliable, and versatile in urban combat scenarios. The rifle is notable for its integrated 40mm grenade launcher and the use of a bullpup configuration, which positions the magazine behind the trigger, allowing for a more compact design without sacrificing barrel length.


== Design and Features ==
The A-91 uses a gas-operated system with a rotating bolt, similar to the AK-47 and other Kalashnikov designs. However, unlike most  Russian rifles, it adopts a bullpup layout, which reduces the overall length while maintaining a full-length barrel, improving handling in confined spaces.
The rifle can be chambered in multiple calibers, 
including the standard Russian 5.45×39mm and 7.62×39mm rounds, as well as the NATO- standard 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge. Its rate of fire is approximately 600 rounds per minute, with a muzzle velocity of 880 m/s.

One of the most notable features of the A-91 is its integrated under-barrel grenade launcher, designed to fire standard 40mm grenades such as the VOG-25. The launcher has a range of up to 400 meters. The rifle also has a spent-case ejection system that ejects casings forward, preventing interference with the user's face or arms when firing from the left shoulder.


== Development ==
The A-91 was designed by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau as a successor to the 9A-91 carbine, with a focus on creating a weapon suited for both conventional and special operations forces. The bullpup design was chosen for its compact size and ease of handling in close-quarter combat (CQB). Initial production began in the 1990s, and the rifle has since been used in various roles within the Russian military.


== Variants ==
There are several variants of the A-91, including different configurations for different calibers and missions:

A-91M: The most modern variant, featuring updated materials and improved ergonomic features. Chambered in both 5.45×39mm and 7.62×39mm.
OTs-14 Groza: A related bullpup rifle also designed by KBP, focused on close-quarters combat and available in 7.62×39mm and 9×39mm.


== Usage ==
The A-91 is in limited service with the Russian Armed Forces and various special forces units. Its compact design and versatility make it suitable for urban combat and special operations, although it has not seen widespread adoption compared to more traditional Kalashnikov designs like the AK-74 and its variants.

=== A-A line ===
The Arkhangelsk–Astrakhan line, or A–A line for short, was the military goal of Operation Barbarossa. It is also known as the Volga–Arkhangelsk line, as well as (more rarely) the Volga–Arkhangelsk–Astrakhan line. It was first mentioned on 18 December 1940 in Führer Directive 21 (Fall Barbarossa) which enunciated the set goals and conditions of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, describing the attainment of the "general line Volga–Archangelsk" as its overall military objective.


== Background ==
The line had its origins in an earlier military study carried out in the summer of 1940 by General Erich Marcks called the Operation Draft East. This report advocated the occupation of the Soviet Union up to the line "Arkhangelsk-Gorky-Rostov" in order to prevent it from being a threat to Germany in the future and "protect it against enemy bombers". Marcks envisioned that the campaign, including the capture of Moscow and beyond, would require between nine and seventeen weeks to complete.
The hypothetical A-A line was to stretch from the port city of Arkhangelsk on the White Sea in northern Russia to the port city of Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga River on the Caspian Sea. Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union failed to secure any of these objectives.


== Goals ==
The plan was for the Red Army to the west of the line to be defeated in a quick military campaign in 1941 before the onset of winter. The Wehrmacht assumed that the majority of Soviet military supplies and the main part of the food and population potential of the Soviet Union existed in the lands that lay to the west of the proposed A-A line. If the line was reached, the Soviet Union would also be deprived of around 86% of its petroleum assets (oil territories in the Caucasus).
The A-A line as the end-goal of military hostilities was chosen because an occupation of the entire Soviet Union in a single military campaign was considered impossible in view of its geographic dimensions. The remaining Soviet industrial centers further eastward were planned to be destroyed by aerial bombardment, for which an entire Luftflotte ("air fleet"; equivalent in status to an army group) was to be assigned.

=== A-B Helicopters A/W 95 ===
The A-B Helicopters A/W 95 is an American helicopter, produced by A-B Helicopters in the form of plans for amateur construction.
By 2012 the A-B Helicopters website had been taken down and plans are no longer available.
The design was developed into the Vortech A/W 95 and plans for that version remain available from Vortech.


== Design and development ==
The A/W 95 is a development of the Adams-Wilson Choppy, which the A/W designation acknowledges. The A/W 95 was designed to comply with the US Experimental Amateur-built rules, since the empty weight is too heavy for the FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, which stipulates a maximum empty weight of 254 lb (115 kg). The aircraft has a standard empty weight of 271 lb (123 kg). It features a single main rotor, a single-seat open cockpit without a windshield, skid landing gear and a twin cylinder, air-cooled, two-stroke, dual-ignition 50 hp (37 kW) Rotax 503 engine.
The aircraft fuselage is an open frame made from bolted-together and gusseted aluminum tubing. Its 19.5 ft (5.9 m) diameter two-bladed extruded aluminum rotor has a chord of 7 in (17.8 cm) and employs a symmetrical airfoil. The transmission is constructed from a belt and chain mechanism. With its standard empty weight of 271 lb (123 kg) and a gross weight of 490 lb (222 kg), the useful load is 219 lb (99 kg). Fuel tank capacity is 5 U.S. gallons (19 L; 4.2 imp gal), rendering a full-fuel payload of 189 lb (86 kg).
While the A/W 95 is primarily plans-built, during the time that A-B Helicopters was in business some pre-fabricated parts were available.


== Operational history ==
By January 2013 two examples had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration.

=== A-Ba-Ni-Bi ===
"A-Ba-Ni-Bi" (Hebrew script: א-ב-ני-בי; bet-language language game for the word אני aní, meaning "I" in Hebrew) is a song recorded by Israeli group Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta, with music composed by Nurit Hirsh and Hebrew lyrics written by Ehud Manor. It represented Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978 held in Paris, winning the contest.


== Background ==


=== Conception ===
"A-Ba-Ni-Bi" was composed by Nurit Hirsh with lyrics by Ehud Manor, a duo who had collaborated frequently in writing Israeli Eurovision entries, including the country's debut "Ey Sham". It is an up-tempo disco number, heralding a move towards this style of performance in later years. In addition to the version fully in Hebrew, Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta recorded a version with English and Hebrew lyrics. The Alphabeta was a group of singers composed by two men, Reuven Erez and Itzhak Okev, and three women, Lisa Gold-Rubin, Nehama Shutan, and Esther Tzuberi.
The song deals with the way in which children relate to love. Cohen sings that, growing up, "we loved secretly/Who were we nice to?—Just uncles and aunts" and that love was conducted secretly and "We whispered only in the 'bet language'". He compares this to adulthood, where he realises that "Love is a beautiful word" and that humanity should "speak in a language of love", instead of the language of secrecy. For this reason, the song uses the Bet language—a children's language game where each syllable of the word is repeated with a bet preceding the vowel. Thus, the Hebrew a-ni  o-hev  o-tach (אני אוהב אותך, "I love you") becomes a-ba-ni-bi  o-bo-he-be-v  o-bo-ta-ba-ch. Mistakenly, the song title was captioned on screen at the contest as being "Ah-Bah-Nee-Bee" and was further confused in the UK singles market when listed on the official singles chart compiled by Music Week as "A-Bi-Ni-Bi". Musically, the song is somewhat unusual among Contest entries for ending almost immediately after the key change—most entries have either a bridge or a repetition of the chorus after this point.


=== Eurovision ===
On 11 February 1978, "A-Ba-Ni-Bi" performed by Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta competed in the national final that the Israeli Broadcasting Authority (IBA) organized to select its song and performer for the 23rd edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. The song won the competition so it became the Israeli entry –and Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta the performers– for Eurovision.
On 22 April 1978, the Eurovision Song Contest was held at the Palais des Congrès in Paris hosted by Télévision Française 1 (TF1) and broadcast live throughout the continent. Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta performed "A-Ba-Ni-Bi" eighteenth on the evening, following Luxembourg's "Parlez-vous français?" by Baccara and preceding Austria's "Mrs. Caroline Robinson" by Springtime. Nurit Hirsh conducted the event's live orchestra in the performance of the Israeli entry.
At the close of voting, the song had received 157 points, placing first in a field of twenty, and winning the contest. The song received points from every other voting country except Sweden, including six sets of maximum 12 points. This was Israel's first Eurovision win, and it was succeeded in 1979 as contest winner and as Israeli entry by "Hallelujah" by Milk and Honey. Israel thus became the third country, after Spain (1968 and 1969) and Luxembourg (1972 and 1973), to win the contest in two successive years.
It was reported that several broadcasters of the non-participating Arab countries who were broadcasting the contest, cut abruptly the broadcast when it was clear Israel was going to win. Jordanian television cut the broadcast and showed pictures of flowers.


=== Aftermath ===
Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta performed their song in the Eurovision twenty-fifth anniversary show Songs of Europe held on 22 August 1981 in Mysen. Izhar Cohen returned to Eurovision in the 1985 contest held in Gothenburg with "Olé, Olé", finishing fifth in a field of nineteen.
The song was performed as part of a medley of favorites in the opening number of the Eurovision fiftieth anniversary competition Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 22 October 2005 in Copenhagen, and in the opening number of the semi-final of the 2006 contest, held on 18 May 2006 in Athens.

"A-Ba-Ni-Bi" was covered by Grup Vitamin, Turkish parody music group as "Acaba bu ne baba be?" ("I wonder what is this dad, hey?" in Turkish) in Aşkın gözyaşları ("Tears of Love"), which was their 1994 album.
A parody of the song, with identical Hebrew lyrics in the first two lines and two lines in Mandarin Chinese, was used as the opening song of Hong Kong broadcaster TVB's 2009 game show Boom Boom Ba.
The song was performed in 2018, on a one-stringed guitar by Israeli singer Netta Barzilai who won the Eurovision Song Contest 2018.
The song was covered by:

Connie Francis
Beti Jurković in Croatian, as "Ja pa te pe vo po lim pi" (from ja te volim, also "I love you")
Frederik in Finnish, as "Rakkauden aika."
El Chaval de la Peca (Marc Parrot) in Spanish.
It was also parodied as "I wanna be a polar bear" (intentionally misheard lyrics).
A Thai rendition of the song, performed by Thai singer Hongtong Daoudon, was featured on the third season of The White Lotus.

=== A-C Central Community Unit School District 262 ===
A-C Central Community Unit School District 262 brings together students from Ashland and Chandlerville, Illinois. A small, rural district, A-C Central has an elementary school (K–4) in Chandlerville, a junior high school (5–8) in Ashland, and a high school (9–12) at the same facility as the junior high school in Ashland.
The territory covers 150 square miles (390 km2) in Cass County, Morgan County, Sangamon County, and Menard County. As of 2012, there were approximately 435 students: 196 at A-C Central Elementary, 93 at A-C Central Junior High School, and 139 at A-C Central High School. Also in 2012, the district had 40 certified teachers, 6 bus routes, and 1 special education bus route.


== History ==
Ashland – Chandlerville Community Unit School District No. 262 was formed by the consolidation of Chandlerville Community Unit School District 62 and Ashland Community Unit School District 212 in 1989.  The consolidation was passed by public referendum.  On 25 March 1997, the school board changed the district name to A-C Central Community Unit School District No. 262, renamed the Chandlerville school to A-C Central Junior High, and renamed the Ashland school to A-C Central Elementary School.
As of 2005, the school district has approximately 203 elementary students, 143 junior high students and 150 high school students.
The future for A-C Central is a bit unclear. Like nearly all of the small districts surrounding it, A-C Central faces budget issues.  In 2005, a referendum was put before the voters of A-C Central and adjacent Virginia Community Unit School District 64 to consolidate the two districts. The referendum failed, leaving the Virginia school district in a desperate financial situation. Consolidation is back on the BoE agenda for their regular board meeting 16 December 2009 though.
A-C Central consolidation with PORTA Community Unit School District 202 failed in the 18 March 2014 election.  The referendum passed by 1,755 to 548 in the PORTA district, but was voted down in the A-C district, by 424 to 515 in Cass County and 46 to 88 in Morgan County.

=== A-Cha (song) ===
"A-Cha" is a song recorded by South Korean boy band Super Junior that was released on September 19, 2011, by their label SM Entertainment and distributed by KMP Holdings as the lead single for their fourth reissue album A-Cha, a reissue of the group's fifth studio album, Mr. Simple. The Japanese version of the track is featured on the group's debut Japanese studio album, Hero which was released in 2013.


== Background ==
Following the release of the Mr. Simple album in August 2011, Super Junior announced plans for album reissue called A-Cha along with its lead single of the same name on September 15. "A-Cha" was released on September 19, the same day as the reissue album's release.


== Composition ==
"A-Cha" features the vocals of nine active members — Leeteuk, Heechul, Yesung, Sungmin, Shindong, Eunhyuk, Donghae, Ryeowook, and Kyuhyun. Kangin was away on mandatory military service.
The song is based on electrohouse and rock which separated it from the group's existing dance songs such as "Sorry, Sorry" and "Bonamana" that were dubbed as "SJ Funky." The song's melody was composed and arranged by Hitchiker. It was composed in the key of D major with the tempo of 125 beats per minute.
Its lyrics were penned by Kim Boo-min, narrating the song akin to Alonso Quijano of the Don Quixote novel, a character trying to hold on to his wavering lover.


== Music video ==
The teaser for the music video was released on the evening of September 23 on SM Town's YouTube and Facebook pages. The full music video was released on the following day.

=== A-Channel ===
A-Channel (proposed as The Alberta Channel) was a Canadian television system initially owned by Craig Media from September 1997 to 2004, then by CHUM Limited from 2004 to 2005 through A-Channel, Inc. It consisted of Craig's television stations in Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton and was the company's unsuccessful attempt to build a national network.
A-Channel launched on September 18, 1997, in Edmonton (CKEM-TV) and September 20 in Calgary (CKAL-TV); Craig's Winnipeg-market station, MTN in Portage la Prairie, rebranded as A-Channel in 1999. The stations were similar in style to Citytv, with an aggressive, urban, street-level, and younger approach to local news and entertainment, including long morning shows and—in Edmonton—midweek telecasts of Edmonton Oilers hockey. In addition, CHUM Limited, owner of Citytv, provided A-Channel with most of its non-local entertainment programming. A-Channel slowly built an audience in its first several years of operation, settling into third place in prime time news ratings and audience.
Craig attempted to expand beyond, particularly to the Vancouver market, but lost out on multiple occasions to other applicants. In 2002, it successfully obtained a licence for a new Toronto station, Toronto 1. However, Craig lost money in startup costs for the new service; at the same time, it grappled with a five-month-long strike at the Edmonton A-Channel station that saw their local news ratings drop by more than half. In January 2004, Craig Media put itself on the market. CHUM Limited, which had been highly desirous of an entry into the Alberta market for some time, acquired the three A-Channel stations. On August 2, 2005, CHUM folded the stations into the Citytv network. On the same date, the A-Channel name was transferred to the stations collectively referred to as NewNet in Southern Ontario and on Vancouver Island, which are currently operated by Bell Media under the CTV 2 banner. The three original Craig Media A-Channel (now Citytv) stations are now owned by Rogers Sports & Media.


== Hearing process ==
In 1993, The Alberta Channel Inc., a majority-owned company of Craig Broadcast Systems, applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a television service in the province of Alberta, to be known as The Alberta Channel (or A-Channel, for short). Craig owned two stations in its home province of Manitoba, namely CKX-TV, a CBC Television affiliate in Brandon, and the Manitoba Television Network (MTN) in Portage la Prairie and serving Winnipeg. Craig's application competed with AltaWest Television, a subsidiary of the CanWest Global System. The Alberta Channel promised stations in Calgary and Edmonton as well as repeaters to serve Drumheller, Lethbridge, and Red Deer. The Calgary and Edmonton stations would each offer 20 hours a week of local news plus the same amount of non-news local programming. The AltaWest bid, part of network parent CanWest's bid to turn Global into a third national network, envisioned a main station in Calgary. In the end, the CRTC opted not to award either group a licence, saying that neither proposal "would have added sufficient diversity" to Alberta television and would have harmed the province's existing television broadcasters.
In 1996, CanWest and Craig tried again with plans for new television service in Alberta. The A-Channel stations in Calgary and Edmonton would be autonomous, each employing 139 people; Craig also promised a C$14 million investment in independent television production in Alberta. The newscasts would have a style similar to Citytv in Toronto; U.S. entertainment programming would come from previously untapped sources, such as Fox and UPN.
Both bids drew concern from rural broadcasters, such as RDTV in Red Deer. Edmonton's CITV protested the CanWest bid, believing it would cause "an unbalancing of the Canadian broadcasting system". CITV subleased the Edmonton-market rights to many popular U.S. shows from CanWest and stood to lose much of its highest-rated programming were they to establish a Global station there.
After a hearing in July, the CRTC issued a ruling in favor of A-Channel and against CanWest in November 1996. Unlike two years prior, it found the Alberta television market to be "stronger than the national average". Craig won out because of its promises to air more local programming and schedule more Canadian production in prime time. CanWest appealed to the federal cabinet, having suffered a blow to its ambitions of constructing a third national network. It believed that the smaller Craig, which it called "boutique", was less preferable than a third national choice for Canadians. The cabinet rejected CanWest's appeal in January 1997 and permitted Craig to construct the A-Channel stations, though it endorsed inquiries into a third national TV network, a minor win for the company.


== Construction ==

With the CanWest bid denied, Craig began constructing the A-Channel stations. In Edmonton, A-Channel set up in the heritage-listed Hudson's Bay building on Jasper Avenue, where it added large windows to its streetside studio; historic preservation conditions complicated work, with new tiles having to be ordered from Quebec. It obtained rights to midweek telecasts of Edmonton Oilers hockey. Most of the on-air talent hired for A-Channel Edmonton came from outside the market, except for Bruce Buchanan, who handled Oilers play-by-play.
The Calgary station at 7th Avenue and 5th Street SW, adjacent to the LRT system, was the only major media outlet in the city to be built in the downtown area. As in Edmonton, much of the on-air talent came from elsewhere in Canada.
In conjunction with winning the licence, Craig established the A-Channel Drama Fund (later the A-Channel Production Fund), which provided financing for made-in-Alberta television movies for air by A-Channel and other outlets. Among these was Ebenezer, a 1998 adaptation of A Christmas Carol starring Jack Palance. The concept of funding independent producers and then obtaining rights to their films was inspired by the UK's Channel 4.


=== Launch ===
A-Channel launched in Edmonton on CKEM-TV (channel 51, cable 7) on September 18, 1997, and in Calgary on CKAL-TV (channel 5, cable 8) on September 20. The new stations were the first in their respective markets since Edmonton's CITV (1974) and Calgary's CBRT (1975). Both stations relied on prime-time movies, a formula Craig had used with some success at MTN in Manitoba. For local programming, they offered a two-hour morning newscast, The Big Breakfast; 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts; and the local programs Live @ Five and Wired, among others.
The new stations had very rough debuts from a technical standpoint. The Calgary station launched four minutes late due to inaccurate clocks; the first 6 p.m. newscast on Monday, dubbed by station staff as "Black Monday", was riddled with errors, leaving anchorman Glen Carter on screen when news footage did not play out. In Edmonton, Jennifer Lyall, the co-host for the local Wired entertainment magazine, quit after just one day on air after not being given time to rehearse. News footage showed on the wrong stories or froze, while sound failed to play out. At one news conference, a local politician saw an A-Channel cameraman enter the room and began mouthing his words without speaking, mimicking the frequently missing audio on the station's newscasts. Many of the issues came down to the tapeless playback and editing system, which had a tendency to delete segments and stories: over five days, the Calgary control room was rewired to bypass it in favor of older, but more reliable, video tape equipment. As part of building A-Channel,  Craig agreed to provide some protection to rural broadcasters by delaying the launch of rebroadcasters for one year, and in 1998, the Lethbridge transmitter (rebroadcasting Calgary) opened. The Edmonton station debuted on cable in Red Deer that year, with a rebroadcaster following the next year.
Both stations made respectable debuts after quickly putting their issues behind them. BBM figures for spring 1998 showed A-Channel Calgary in third place in prime time, though its dinner-hour news lagged the CBC. Likewise, A-Channel surpassed the CBC in prime time in Edmonton, but its local programs—outside of hockey—attracted few viewers. BBM found that Live @ Five, the station's 5:00 news program, had just 600 viewers. Over the next two years, the stations became more competitive, with increasing ratings towards their local morning and evening programming.
The A-Channel stations built identities as aggressive outlets appealing to a younger demographic in their local and syndicated programming, similar to Citytv in Toronto. The newscasts reflected this style, with anchors walking around the set and handheld camerawork. In an assessment of the Calgary station in 1999, Gary Davies noted, "It's very rare to attend a media event in this city and not see a representative from A-Channel." All stations had SUVs emblazoned with black-and-yellow paint schemes. A-Channel Calgary had a Hummer as a newsgathering vehicle; when a major snowstorm paralyzed traffic in the city in March 1998, the station responded to a call for assistance by using the Hummer to deliver Meals on Wheels to stranded Calgarians, even ferrying a snowed-in doctor to work.
The Oilers departed A-Channel Edmonton after the 2000–2001 season and consolidated their television games with Sportsnet West, adding 28 games to the latter's existing 20-game inventory. The team was believed to see increased revenue opportunity with a regional telecast. In 2001, A-Channel also moved its late news in Alberta from 10 to 11 p.m., putting it in head-to-head competition with the other Alberta stations and reducing overruns from its movies.


== Expansion beyond Alberta ==
MTN joined the A-Channel system in 1999; Craig built new downtown studios in Winnipeg's The Forks district. The Winnipeg station expanded its news staff by 15 and adopted the trappings of the Calgary and Edmonton stations, including The Big Breakfast.
Craig made proposals for other television properties across the country in the late 1990s and early 2000s. At the same time as its successful A-Channel application, it filed to build a channel titled Very Independent Television in Vancouver and Victoria. That bid failed, and Baton Broadcasting won the channel. In 1999, Craig tried again for a station in Victoria, losing out to the bid's only competitor, CHUM Limited. Craig lost yet again to CHUM when it attempted to acquire CKVU-TV in Vancouver; not only did the deal prevent Craig from moving into the lucrative market, but it also put CHUM firmly above Craig as a media company. Further, CHUM was Craig's primary supplier of programs, at one point accounting for 90 percent of the non-local programming in A-Channel's stations. Matthew Fraser, writing in the National Post, observed that Craig's reliance on CHUM for programs allowed the latter company to either pressure for a sale now or "slowly squeeze" Craig in the long term. In 2002, Craig was successful at the CRTC and won the license for Toronto 1, a new local station in the capital city. This new service, however, did not follow the programming concept of the A-Channel stations. Compounded with the launch of MTV and MTV2 Canada, this led to strong overlap between Craig and CHUM and intensified the rivalry between the companies. Shortly after, CHUM filed for stations in Edmonton and Calgary.


== A CRTC review and a strike in Edmonton ==
Craig Broadcast Systems asked the CRTC to bring the licence terms of its Alberta and Manitoba stations in line to expire at the same time, leading to A-Channel facing its first licence hearings two years early. CanWest, in a letter, accused Craig of not following through on all of its spending commitments on which it had won the Alberta licences in 1996, stating that it was behind schedule on its production spending and producing less local programming per week than it had promised. Industry officials also sought that further investment in the Production Fund become a condition of licence.
In July 2002, a majority of A-Channel Edmonton employees signed union cards and organized under the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, which represented employees at Edmonton's other TV stations. Contract negotiations were unsuccessful, with the parties at odds over wages and a promise to not move jobs from Edmonton to Calgary; for the start of the fall television season, on September 17, 2003, workers walked out and began a strike. A-Channel continued airing newscasts because only 10 to 15 employees crossed the picket line, out of 108 total. Picketers made it difficult for employees to get inside the studios and sometimes followed news crews, while the union mounted a pressure campaign to urge national advertisers to cease doing business with A-Channel. Union members rejected a contract offer in December 2003, though about a third of the members had returned to work.
The strike was disastrous for A-Channel's ratings in the Edmonton market. A-Channel News at Six lost more than 60 percent of its viewership and slipped into a tie with the CBC for last place. At the same time, startup costs for Toronto 1 and a series of new digital specialty channels proved to be a drain on Craig's finances. In late January, Craig Media put itself up for sale. Weeks later, on February 14, 2004, strikers overwhelmingly voted to accept a contract offer, recognizing that much work was needed to regain the viewership that A-Channel had lost during the strike.


== CHUM acquisition and folding into Citytv ==

On April 12, 2004, CHUM Limited announced a deal to purchase Craig Media for $265 million. The move came more than a month after the CRTC denied CHUM's applications for new Calgary and Edmonton stations because the market did not have sufficient advertising revenue to support a new entrant. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on November 19, 2004. CHUM had to sell off Toronto 1 because it already owned stations in Toronto (CITY) and nearby Barrie (CKVR); Toronto 1 was sold to Quebecor Media, owners of the media units TVA and Sun Media.
In February 2005, CHUM announced it would align Craig's A-Channel stations with its existing major-market stations under the Citytv name. No other significant changes were made, since the A-Channel stations's on-air look had always been very similar to that of Citytv; they initially retained their local programs, relaunched under Citytv's Breakfast Television morning brand and CityNews news brand. CHUM hoped to lift the ratings of the stations with the new moniker. The change took effect on August 2 of the same year, when the A-Channel name was transferred to CHUM's NewNet stations.


== Programming ==


=== Local programming ===
At launch, the A-Channel stations in Calgary and Edmonton offered a two-hour morning program, known as The Big Breakfast. The anchors were Mark Scholz and Yvette Czigli in Edmonton and Dave Kelly and Robin Gill in Calgary. When MTN became A-Channel in Winnipeg in 1999, it began a local edition of The Big Breakfast helmed by Jon Ljungberg and Jay Onrait. In addition, each station produced local evening newscasts. A-Channel also produced Wired, an entertainment magazine, in Calgary and Edmonton.
The A-Channel stations contributed to The Sharing Circle, a program on First Nations communities which was produced from Manitoba. This program later became independent of the Craig chain when company patriarch Stu Craig sold the rights to host to Lisa Meeches.


=== Entertainment ===
A-Channel generally sourced its American entertainment programming from smaller outlets, including The WB and UPN, which were not widely available on their own in Canada. With the notable exception of the 2002–03 television season, Craig's program acquisition strategy was generally frugal. Canadian series it aired included CityLine, To Serve and Protect, and 1-800-Missing.

However, in 2012 the BEP left the alliance after disagreeing with the leadership of ABOP head Ronnie Brunswijk.
Prior to the 2015 elections Seeka left the A-Combination to join A Nyun Combinatie. However, the alliance was joined by the Party for National Unity and Solidarity (which had pulled out of the V7 alliance) and the Party for Democracy and Development. In the elections the alliance received 11% of the vote, winning five seats.
The coalition was dissolved prior to the 2020 elections.

=== A-DNA ===
A-DNA is one of the possible double helical structures which DNA can adopt. A-DNA is thought to be one of three biologically active double helical structures along with B-DNA and Z-DNA. It is a right-handed double helix fairly similar to the more common B-DNA form, but with a shorter, more compact helical structure whose base pairs are not perpendicular to the helix-axis as in B-DNA. It was discovered by Rosalind Franklin, who also named the A and B forms. She showed that DNA is driven into the A form when under dehydrating conditions. Such conditions are commonly used to form crystals, and many DNA crystal structures are in the A form. The same helical conformation occurs in double-stranded RNAs, and in DNA-RNA hybrid double helices.


== Structure ==
Like the more common B-DNA, A-DNA is a right-handed double helix with major and minor grooves. However, as shown in the comparison table below, there is a slight increase in the number of base pairs (bp) per turn. This results in a smaller twist angle, and smaller rise per base pair, so that A-DNA is 20-25% shorter than B-DNA. The major groove of A-DNA is deep and narrow, while the minor groove is wide and shallow. A-DNA is broader and more compressed along its axis than B-DNA.
The identifiable characteristic of A-DNA X-ray crystallography is the hole in the center.  A-DNA has a C3'-endo pucker, which refers to the C3' carbon in the furanose ring being below the sugar plane.


== Comparison geometries of the most common DNA forms ==


== A/B intermediates ==
Research also indicates that A-form DNA can hybridize with the more common B-DNA. These A-B intermediate forms adopt the sugar pucker properties and/or the base conformation of both DNA forms. In one study, the characteristic C3'-endo pucker is found on the first three sugars of the DNA strand, while the last three sugars have a C2'-endo pucker, like B-DNA. These intermediates can form in aqueous solutions when the cytosine bases are methylated or brominated, altering the conformation. Alternatively, guanine and cytosine rich fragments have been shown to be easily converted from B to A-form in aqueous solutions.


== Biological function ==
A-DNA can be derived from a few processes, including dehydration and protein binding. Dehydration of DNA drives it into the A form, which has been shown to protect DNA under conditions such as the extreme desiccation of bacteria. Protein binding can also strip solvent off of DNA and convert it to the A form, as revealed by the structure of several hyperthermophilic archaeal viruses. These viruses include rod-shaped rudiviruses SIRV2  and SSRV1, enveloped filamentous lipothrixviruses AFV1, SFV1  and SIFV, tristromavirus PFV2  as well as icosahedral portoglobovirus SPV1. A-form DNA is believed to be one of the adaptations of hyperthermophilic archaeal viruses to harsh environmental conditions in which these viruses thrive.
It has been proposed that the motors that package double-stranded DNA in bacteriophages exploit the fact that A-DNA is shorter than B-DNA, and that conformational changes in the DNA itself are the source of the large forces generated by these motors. Experimental evidence for A-DNA as an intermediate in viral biomotor packing comes from double dye Förster resonance energy transfer measurements showing that B-DNA is shortened by 24% in a stalled ("crunched") A-form intermediate. In this model, ATP hydrolysis is used to drive protein conformational changes that alternatively dehydrate and rehydrate the DNA, and the DNA shortening/lengthening cycle is coupled to a protein-DNA grip/release cycle to generate the forward motion that moves DNA into the capsid.

=== A-Darter ===
The V3E A-Darter (Agile Darter) is a modern short-range infrared homing ("heat seeking") air-to-air missile, featuring countermeasures resistance with a 180-degree look angle and 120-degrees per second track rate, developed by South Africa's Denel Dynamics (formerly Kentron) and Brazil's Mectron (now SIATT), Avibras and Opto Eletrônica (acquired by AKAER). It will equip the South African Air Force's Saab JAS 39 Gripen C/D and BAE Hawk 120, and the Brazilian Air Force's A-1M AMX, Northrop F-5BR and Gripen E/F. It was expected to be in production before the end of 2015. As of November 2022, no combat capable missiles had been produced.


== Development ==
Development of the A-Darter began in 1995, but the program suffered from inadequate funding and changes to the SAAF's requirements. Mectron, Avibras and Atech joined the program in 2006 after a three-year negotiation process with US$52 million invested by the Brazilian Government in the project, estimated to be worth US$130 million. In that same year, Denel announced that it would use the latest solid-state inertial measurement unit, the SiIMU02 from BAE Systems, for mid course range guidance. The Brazilian company Opto Eletrônica has partnered with Denel Dynamics in the development of the missile imaging infrared seeker for thermal guidance.
Ground seeker tests were concluded in January 2010, while trajectory guidance and agility flight tests were performed in February 2010. Prototypes were sent to Saab AB to begin the integration of the missile to the Saab JAS 39 Gripen. Captive flight trials were concluded in March 2010. The first successful in-flight launch from a Gripen fighter took place on 17 June 2010.
In March 2012, Denel Dynamics disclosed that the missile, which was to be ready for production by end of 2013, entered the qualification phase. Several testing firings at Denel's Overberg Test Range were carried out from a Gripen in January 2012. Final testing included the use of high-speed target drones to simulate an aircraft by towing infrared targets at high speed.
In December 2012, the Brazilian air force commissioned Denel to build a factory in São José dos Campos, close to Mectron, Avibras and Opto Eletrônica.
In February 2015, Denel Dynamics signed an agreement with Marotta Controls for supply of the latter's MPACT pure air compression technology to cool the A-Darter's infrared seeker.


== Production ==
In March 2015 SAAF ordered 41 operational missiles, 21 trainer variants and 8 practice variants from Denel Dynamics. At this time deliveries were to be completed by October 2017.
Production of the missiles has been delayed. Testing was finalised in November 2019. Due to liquidity problems affecting Denel and the resignation of key personnel, no combat capable missiles had been produced as of November 2022. 
As of October 2024 Denel has begun delivering practice missiles to the South African Air Force, with operational missiles to be delivered in March or April of 2025.


== Design ==
The missile seeker can be slaved to the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD), allowing the pilot to track a target beyond the aircraft's radar scan envelope using the missile's high off-boresight capability, achieved by the pilot turning his head towards the target to lock-on, better known as "look and shoot". The missile can then be launched and can immediately pull extreme g-force to reverse its course to engage a target behind the aircraft, sometimes called an "over-the-shoulder". Engage modes include Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capability to engage targets outside its seeker's acquisition range, and Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) capability where the target is identified and designated before launch. The two colour thermal imaging technology and a laser proximity fuse fitted on the missile provide multiple Electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) techniques with targeting algorithms including advanced spatial filtering techniques and velocity profiling.
The A-Darter has four major sections:  guidance section, warhead, control, and rocket motor. It uses a streamlined design with low aerodynamic drag in a wingless airframe, ensuring ranges beyond those of traditional short-range missiles. It is fitted with a thrust vectoring control (TVC) system that allows for turning at up to 100g and 
for a period of 8 seconds while the motor burns, after which the missile can still retain 50g of manoverability.
The absence of aluminium powder in the motor propellent inhibits production of a smoke trail, which means no visual warning for enemy aircraft. According to SAAF fighter pilots involved within the project, the A-Darter it is better than the IRIS-T in some respects.

=== A-Day (University of Alabama) ===
A-Day is an annual college football exhibition game set at the conclusion of spring practice by the University of Alabama Crimson Tide. Played on-campus at Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, the game features teams composed of offensive starters against defensive starters of the Crimson Tide. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules allow for member schools to conduct a series of fifteen practice sessions during the spring months. As part of these practices the NCAA allows three 11-on-11 scrimmages, one of which may be conducted as a spring game.
Prior to the game, the captains from the  previous seasons' team are honored at the annual "Walk of Fame" ceremony at the base of Denny Chimes. In addition to this ceremony, several other memorable events have occurred as part of the annual A-Day festivities. The 1967 edition of the game saw Dock Rone and Andrew Pernell participate and become the first African American players to play at Denny Stadium as members of the Crimson Tide football team. At halftime of the 1976 game, Denny Stadium was officially rededicated as Bryant–Denny Stadium in honor of then head coach Bear Bryant. The 1985 edition of the A-Day game featured a White team of current, varsity starters against a Crimson team of former Alabama players such as Ken Stabler and Ozzie Newsome.
Since the arrival of head coach Nick Saban in 2007, A-Day has become a major event. The 2007 game saw an overflow crowd of 92,138 in attendance and served as the catalyst for other programs to make their spring game a larger event. The growth of A-Day has resulted in its being televised nationally by ESPN first in 2009 and again in subsequent years in addition to being utilized to enhance recruiting.


== History ==
Originally, the A-Day game was called the Red and White Game and was played on Alumni Day. Alumni Day was a day devoted to alumni and typically consisted of coffees, luncheons, tours, the football game, and an alumni dinner. Recently, there has been an alumni flag football game inside the Bryant-Denny Stadium preceding the A-Day game.

=== A-Eiropa ===
A-Europa, also known as A-Eiropa, is a Europop band from Latvia. The name A-Eiropa originally stood for "Austrumeiropa" which means "Eastern Europe" in Latvian.
A quite unusual cultural phenomenon is the fact that the group most often releases two versions of songs - one in Latvian and another in Russian (same music, different verses) - or mixes both languages in the same song.
The originator and voice of the group is Artūrs Duboks, who lives in the city of Daugavpils in Latvia.
The group has several times ranked in the top of the hits list for national radio stations and abroad.  A-Eiropa's hits have included "Baltās rozes"/"Белые розы"  (White roses), "Jūrmala"/"Юрмала" (Jūrmala) and others.

=== A-F Records ===
A-F Records was an American independent record label founded by punk rock band Anti-Flag – namely the band's drummer Pat Thetic, their rhythm guitarist Chris Head, and their lead vocalist Justin Sane – and based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was created to help expose more political punk bands to a larger audience.


== History ==
The band founded the label in 1997 so they could release their 1998 compilation album Their System Doesn't Work for You. The compilation was the first official release under the label as well.
Following the release of their own compilation, the band approached the Pittsburgh-based band Reagan Squad and the Boston-based band The Unseen, both of whom they believed to be "socially conscious," and the two bands released their own full-length LPs through A-F Records. The releases from Reagan Squad and The Unseen were the first non-Anti-Flag albums to be released by the label. Later, band then released East Coast Punk, a compilation featuring several bands that had worked with A-F Records, and stated that they donated the proceeds to a women's shelter. Due to financial concerns, the band exclusively released the East Coast Punk compilation on cassette and distributed it at concerts put on by bands on their label.
The label's offices were damaged when a September 2004 flood hit Pittsburgh. Although employees saved much of the equipment and inventory, A-F Records dropped Inhuman, Tabula Rasa, and Virus Nine in the wake of the flood for financial reasons.
The label's music was formerly distributed on Mordam but moved to RedEye when Mordam was bought by Lumberjack in early 2006.


=== Dissolution ===
On July 19, 2023, Anti-Flag posted an update on their Patreon announcing their disbandment and the intention to refund fans who were subscribed. Following this announcement, their website was taken down, and the band's social media accounts were deleted. When asked to offer a statement regarding the breakup, the band's publicist declined to comment. Stereogum and Us Weekly linked Anti-Flag's July 2023 breakup to a podcast episode released on July 19, the same day as the band's dissolution, that leveled accusations of sexual assault against "a singer in a political punk band" believed to be frontman Justin Sane. In the following months, twelve more women and girls would come forward to accuse Sane of sexual misconduct, grooming, sexual assault, and rape.
Within days of Anti-Flag's breakup, several bands announced their departure from A-F Records, including American Television, Celebration Summer, Darien Gap, Hanalei, Reconciler, Sammy Kay, and Wolves & Wolves & Wolves & Wolves. Several of the bands' departures were mentioned in a September 2023 Rolling Stone exposé discussing the additional accusations against Sane. In the Rolling Stone exposé, the band also informed the magazine that they were "in the process of unwinding the label, including returning master rights and physical records/merchandise to the bands, which will take some time to complete properly."

=== A-Fields natural gas fields ===
The A-Fields (Audrey, Ann, Alison and Annabel) are natural gas reservoirs and gas production facilities in the southern North Sea; about 123 km east of Spurn Head, Yorkshire. The fields produced natural gas from 1988 to 2016.


== The A-fields ==
The Ann gas field was discovered as early as May 1966 and Audrey in March 1976 but there was limited local infrastructure to transport gas to shore. The Lincolnshire Offshore Gas Gathering System (LOGGS) was commissioned in 1988 and designed to act as a hub and central gas processing, compression and transport facility for the area. Gas from LOGGS was routed to the Theddlethorpe gas terminal.
The Audrey field is located in the UK Offshore Blocks 49/11a and 49/15a. The field was initially developed and operated by Phillips Petroleum Co. Ltd., later ConocoPhillips, then by Spirit Energy. The Ann field is in Block 49/06 and 48/10a and was developed by Phillips, later ConocoPhillips, then by Spirit Energy. Alison in Block 49/11a was originally licensed to Phillips. Annabel was in Block 48/10a and was also originally licensed to Phillips, it was designed to produce gas from the Saturn gas field.
The gas reservoirs in the A-Fields are Upper Leman Sandstone Formation of the Lower Permian Rotliegend Group.
Phillips had assigned the letter ‘A’ to the license; all the prospects were given female names starting with ‘A’.


== Development ==
The A-Fields were developed by a number of platforms, subsea structures and pipelines.
The design parameters of the Audrey and Ann production facilities are summarised in the table.    

The design parameters of the Alison, Annabel and Ensign production facilities are summarised in the table.   

In addition to the gas production pipelines there were also 3-inch methanol pipelines from  LOGGS to Audrey A and B and to Ensign. There were also control umbilicals to the subsea wellheads.


== Gas production ==
A summary of the key gas production data for the A-Fields is shown in the table.

The gas production profile, in mcm/y, for Audrey is as shown.


== Decommissioning ==
The Alison and Ann fields had reached the end of their economic lives in 2010 and 2012 and were closed-in. Audrey was shut down in 2016. Ensign was still operating but the closure of LOGGS and Theddlethorpe gas terminal in August 2018 closed the gas export route; when no alternative export route was found the Ensign installation was decommissioned.

=== A-Force ===
A-Force is a comic book series published by Marvel Comics that debuted in May 2015 as a part of Marvel's "Secret Wars" crossover storyline. It was created by writers G. Willow Wilson, Marguerite Bennett, and artist Jorge Molina. It features Marvel's first all-female Avengers team called the A-Force. The team first appeared as part of an alternate universe during "Secret Wars" but later reemerged in Marvel's primary continuity.
The comic book series generally received positive reviews from critics. It has been described as "decidedly feminist."


== Publication history ==
In February 2015, Marvel Comics announced that they would launch A-Force in May 2015. The series, written by  G. Willow Wilson (Ms. Marvel) and Marguerite Bennett (Angela: Asgard's Assassin) and drawn by Jorge Molina (X-Men), features Marvel's first all-female team of Avengers. The team, led by She-Hulk, initially consists of Dazzler, Medusa, Nico Minoru and Singularity, a new "cosmic powered" hero, but features many more characters. Wilson stated that Marvel editor Daniel Ketchum mandated that the team be composed entirely of female characters, but gave the writers total discretion when it came to which women to choose. Ketchum also brought in Bennett, whom he worked with on Nightcrawler, to co-write the series with Wilson. The series takes place within Marvel's 2015 "Secret Wars" crossover storyline, which finds the entire Marvel Universe, including the Avengers, disbanded. What is left is a patchwork of different environments and on one such environment called Arcadia, which Wilson describes as a "feminist paradise", a familiar threat arises that forces A-Force to come together. Bennett elaborated,

It's this world where the Marvel heroines are leaders in their own civilization. I really didn't want to have some kind of validating reason... So I didn't want to do anything like, "all the men disappeared years ago" or "ever since all the menfolk were killed in that war" or something like that. There are men—there are heroes there. You'll see familiar faces and favorites, but the heroines are in charge, by majority. It's just this is how their world evolved. They were competent. They were clever and they were the ones in charge because of their skills and they were the best fit for these roles and demands of their world.
About the roster Wilson said, "We've purposefully assembled a team composed of very different characters—from disparate parts of the Marvel U, with very different power sets, identities and ideologies. They'll all have to come together to answer some big questions: What would you sacrifice to succeed? What is being a hero worth?" Wilson elaborated:

This an opportunity to put people who would normally have no reason to interact with each other on one team... I want people whose power sets really build on each other so that there are specific limitations that can only become overcome by working together. Nobody's so overpowered that it gets boring and nobody's so underpowered that they have to be saved all the time. I wanted a balance visually and practically... What's also going to be interesting is working out the power structure of the group. You have several people on it who are used to being either their own bosses or in a leadership position, and all of a sudden they're together.
Bennett explained that although the team features a broader roster, Dazzler, Medusa, She-Hulk, Singularity and Nico Minoru make up the core members. Bennett stated that she found Dazzler's optimism to be the most interesting explaining, "It's really hard to write a dark and dire book if you've got Dazzler there beside you." Regarding the dynamic between Medusa and She-Hulk, Bennett said,

They're both leaders and there's a lot of conflict between them. They are very supportive of one another when operating against a third party, but they also disagree with how things should be handled when it comes to crises. Medusa is monarchy; She-Hulk is democracy. Medusa is the right of queens and She-Hulk is the rule of law. She-Hulk is much more balanced than Medusa. It's the two of them playing off of their strengths and sometime playing off of each other for both necessary good and necessary evil.
The series also introduces a new character named Singularity, a pocket universe that gains self-consciousness during "Secret Wars". Wilson likened Singularity to Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation and said, "Her entire existence is so unlike that of ours that she really has to learn about what we think of as being an individual and having an identity from the ground up, with no point of access except those she meets." Wilson also stated that Singularity can act as "a whole world within herself and she can also move between different worlds and dimensions like taking a walk, so she has access to all corners of the Marvel U in a way that other characters do not." "[Nico Minoru is] one of the first people we have encounter Singularity," Bennett revealed. "So Nico is put in charge of acclimating this character and showing her their civilization and world while trying to save it. Nico is sort of like the grounding human force and the anchor that begins to show Singularity the capacity of human beings, both for good and for evil, so Nico becomes even more invested when she starts to see her homeland through the eyes of this stranger."
At the 2015 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, Marvel announced that A-Force would continue into All-New, All-Different Marvel, the next phase of Marvel Universe after the end of "Secret Wars", with a second volume. Wilson said, "After 'Secret Wars', things don't go back to status quo. There [are] long-term repercussions for what has happened in Battleworld. What the aftermath of Secret Wars is for all of those characters who were together in Arcadia who are now waking up in the Marvel Universe... I'm not going to say. But they're going to have to deal probably more directly with those repercussions than any of the other teams in the aftermath of Secret Wars."
In January 2016, Marvel announced that writer Kelly Thompson, who co-wrote A-Force vol. 2, #2, will take over the series with artist Ben Caldwell starting with issue 5. Thompson stated that while she respects the way Wilson built the team, in a world where women are the primary heroes, she does not intend on making stories that are "unique to women". Thompson explained, "It's a comic about super heroes saving the day, plain and simple, and I approach writing them like I would writing anyone. These ladies are heroes just like any of their male colleagues."
In August 2016, A-Force tied into the "Civil War II" storyline beginning with issue #8. About the crossover, Thompson said, "There's no way, with our cast, that we weren't going to get drawn into it – Carol is obviously the big co-star of "Civil War II" and both Medusa and She-Hulk are poised to play big roles too. But I think we've got a really great A-Force story that ties directly to the event but will also stand on its own nicely. Because of the intricacies of "Civil War II" the ideas behind the event really pull our team apart – so what we're doing is a very personal and emotional gut punch of a story for these ladies who were sort of just getting started as friends and as a team."
In October 2016, a day before the release of issue #10, it was reported that A-Force was "effectively cancelled" after no new issues were listed among Marvel's November, December, or January solicitations. The report came despite Thompson's intentions to continue the series after "Civil War II" with a storyline that involved an "unspecified A-lister". Sales of A-Force had fallen by 79% since its debut with issue #1 selling 114,528 copies and issue #9 selling 23,484 copies. However, in a letter written to the fans in the back pages of A-Force #10, Thompson described it as "short hiatus" followed by an editorial note claiming that A-Force would be back and that fans could speed up its return by emailing Marvel.
The series was cancelled in October 2016 due to the sales of A-Force Vol. 2 declining.

=== Secret Wars ===
A-Force, the defenders of the matriarchal Battleworld nation of Arcadia, responds to a megalodon attack while on routine patrol. During the attack, America Chavez throws the shark across the Shield, the wall that separates their borders, thus breaking the laws of God Emperor Doom and is subsequently arrested by Doom's enforcers, the Thor Corps. Despite appeals from Arcadia's baroness She-Hulk Chavez is sentenced to spend the rest of her life on the wall. In response, She-Hulk tasks the Sub-Mariners - Namor, Namorita, and Namora - to find the source of the megalodon attack. Meanwhile, Nico Minoru, lamenting the loss of Chavez, comes across a mysterious figure that fell out of the sky.
The Sub-Mariners discover a strange portal in the ocean's depths but it implodes as they draw near. Later at the behest of female Loki, Minoru introduces her new friend to She-Hulk. When Medusa accuses the stranger, a sentient pocket universe, of creating the portal, a Sentinel falls from another portal and attacks the team. During the fight, the newcomer saves Dazzler and convinces She-Hulk that she is not the cause. After destroying the Sentinel, She-Hulk decides to travel through the still open portal and investigate the source herself.
She-Hulk arrives in the Sentinel Territories and after a brief encounter with more Sentinels, she is chased back to Arcadia by the Thor Corps. The Thor Corps follow in pursuit, but Medusa manages to repel them back into the portal and is killed in the process. When the Thor Corps return, She-Hulk alerts the citizens of Arcadia that there is a traitor in their midst that is spreading discontent and vows to bring them to justice as she and other A-Forcers go into hiding inside the newcomer.
The newcomer smuggles A-Force outside the city. There, She-Hulk realizes that the portals' energy is of Asgardian origin and they deduce that the traitor is Loki. With A-Force outlawed, Loki is set to be crowned the new baroness of Arcadia, but is preemptively attacked by A-Force. After Loki is defeated, she releases a final blast of energy that breaches the Shield thus allowing the zombie horde on the other side to enter.
As the horde approaches, She-Hulk rallies A-Force, the Thor Corps, and other heroes of Arcadia in defense of Arcadia. During the fight, the zombies begin to overwhelm the city but the newcomer – now named Singularity – absorbs the entire horde, sacrificing herself in the process. In the aftermath of the battle, the Thor Corps arrests Loki as A-Force begins reconstruction of Arcadia. Meanwhile, She-Hulk comforts Minoru, who is still mourning the loss of her friends, telling her that she believes Singularity lives on.


=== All-New, All-Different Marvel ===
Following the conclusion of "Secret Wars," Singularity awakes in the primary Earth-616 universe and quickly spots Carol Danvers but Danvers does not recognize her. Unbeknownst to Singularity, she is being pursued by a similar being named Antimatter. While Danvers confronts Antimatter, Singularity flees to New York City. With Antimatter still in pursuit, Singularity locates She-Hulk, who does not remember her either, and asks for help. As the pair fight Antimatter, Medusa arrives with reinforcements and takes Singularity into custody.
After Antimatter kills one of Medusa's soldiers, she releases Singularity and teleports Antimatter to the moon. Realizing that physical attacks are having little effect on Antimatter, Singularity transports She-Hulk, Medusa and herself to Japan to seek the help of Minoru. When Antimatter returns, Minoru casts a spell that causes him to be temporarily unmade. The spell buys the women some time during which Danvers suggests that Antimatter maybe susceptible to intense levels of light particles. They then travel to Miami to recruit Dazzler just as Antimatter remerges.
Dazzler hits Antimatter with everything she has to no avail but it gives Danvers time to activate a containment device that she designed. When Antimatter overloads the device, Singularity has Minoru remove Antimatter's tracking ability and transports the team to The Peak. As Antimatter eventually reaches The Peak, She-Hulk orders Singularity to stay behind while the rest of the team leaves to parley with Antimatter. After talks fail, Antimatter fatally wounds Dazzler and in turn She-Hulk decapitates Antimatter. Angered by Dazzler's death, Singularity leaves to confront a recovered Antimatter one-on-one.
As Singularity fights Antimatter, Dr. Tempest Bell, The Peak's lead scientist, develops a bomb capable of destroying Antimatter but denoting it will also kill Singularity. She-Hulk, Minoru and Danvers go to reinforce Singularity, while Medusa places the bomb inside Antimatter. Just as the bomb explodes, a revived Dazzler arrives with a dimensional teleporter and whisks Singularity away from the blast. With Antimatter destroyed, the team celebrates at a diner when Singularity senses a disturbance as remnants of Antimatter tear open portals to other worlds.
In Astoria, Oregon, A-Force tracks a dragon from Battleworld named Countess and discover that she is being pursued by an alternate version of Dazzler that belonged to the Thor Corps. A-Force joins Dazzler Thor in combat which causes Countess to retreat. As the heroes wait for Countess's return, Dazzler confides to Dazzler Thor that she has been infected by the Terrigen Mist and is dying. When Countess arrives, she takes control of Minoru who then incapacitates the team.
She-Hulk, Medusa, Dazzler, Dazzler Thor, and Danvers awake in a jail cell in Astoria to discover that their powers are gone and the populace under the control of the Countess. After She-Hulk taunts the Countess, she has Minoru turn She-Hulk against the others. As the fight with She-Hulk takes the team away from the city and their powers return, the Countess has Minoru turn their feet into cement shoes and drag them under water.
As the team is about to drown, Minoru commands them to breathe. Once out of the water, She-Hulk sends half the team to distract Countess, while the others rescue Minoru. After being rescued, Minoru reveals the true nature of Countess' powers and returns with Dazzler and Dazzler Thor to confront Countess. Minoru convinces Countess to have a change of heart as Dazzler Thor succumbs to the compounded effects that the Terrigen Mist are having on her otherworldly system. After Dazzler Thor's body vanishes, Dazzler warns her teammates that she may suffer a similar fate.


=== Civil War II ===
After She-Hulk is gravely wounded in a battle with Thanos during the "Civil War II" storyline, Danvers tells Minoru that the Inhuman Ulysses Cain had a vision of her killing a woman named Alice. Refusing to be arrested for a crime that she has yet to commit, Minoru flees to a safehouse in Ouray, Colorado. Unbeknownst to Minoru, the town is under attack from a swarm of giant bugs and encounters Elsa Bloodstone. Bloodstone informs Minoru that the attack is the result of an infection that is turning the populace into insects and takes her to meet Janine, whose daughter Alice has gone missing during the commotion. Meanwhile, Danvers and Medusa race to find Minoru before Dazzler and Singularity, who disagree with their methods.
Danvers and Medusa find Minoru and Bloodstone just before Dazzler and Singularity arrive. After a brief confrontation, they agree to split into two teams: one to find Alice and the other to protect the civilians. While searching for Alice in an abandoned mine, Danvers, Minoru and Bloodstone are attacked by a giant bug. The bug incapacitates Danvers and Bloodstone before telepathically communicating to Minoru that she is Alice and has been inadvertently infecting the townspeople after her transformation. Alice tells Minoru that killing her is the only way to save the people. When Minrou refuses, an infected Bloodstone threatens to kill Danvers.
Medusa, Singularity, and an infected Dazzler are overrun by bugs and regroup with the others just as Bloodstone infects Danvers. After Dazzler infects Medusa, Minoru casts a spell to transform Alice back into a human but it does not cure the rest of the populace. Alice explains that she must be killed and Minoru reluctantly casts a death spell on Alice which transforms the infected back into humans. Alice then remerges in her final form and tells A-Force that she is no longer a threat as she now has greater control of her powers. When the commotion is over, Danvers and Minoru continue to disagree over each other's actions, but agree to visit She-Hulk together in the hospital.

==== Issue 1 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #1 was the 6th best selling comic book in May 2015.

Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave A-Force #1 a grade of 4.5 out of 5 stars, writing, "A-Force #1 is a triumph, taking a concept that could have simply been dashed off and then ignored and turning it into a book that I'd cheerfully read every month. Even if Secret Wars itself is unappealing, this book muscles its way into your heart through sheer quality. If there are any books that somehow survive the end of "Secret Wars," I'd love for this to be one. A-Force is an A-Plus." Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave A-Force #1 a grade of 8.4 out of 10, saying, "While certain details regarding the nature of this team and their connection to the old marvel Universe remain unclear, A-Force #1 marks a worthy debut for Marvel's newest team book. It's fun and fast-paced, but also features great characterization and clear ties to the larger framework of Secret Wars. Marvel picked a solid creative team for this series, and it's already paying off." Lan Pitts of Newsarama gave A-Force #1 a grade of 8 out of 10, praising the artwork of Jorge Molina, Laura Martin, and Matt Milla. Tony Guerrero of Comic Vine gave A-Force #1 a grade of 4 out of 5 stars, stating, "This book was pretty much exactly what I wanted and hoped for. Too many times the female heroes in the Marvel Universe get overlooked. Marguerite Bennett and G. Willow Wilson have created a natural feeling world. It's easy to cry out that having just female heroes is a gimmick but it all simply works here. And it works in a great way. You'll find yourself wanting to know more of the region and the relationship and connections each character has with one another. There's just a wonderful vibe going on. Jorge Molina's art and Laura Martin and Matt Milla's colors add to that. With actual ties to the main SECRET WARS book, this doesn't feel like an isolated story done just for the heck of it. You get a sense that it is part of the bigger story. This is our chance to explore the specific region closely and you'll be glad you got the chance. I'm so ready for the next issue now." Eric Diaz of The Nerdist gave A-Force #1 a grade of 3 out of 5, asserting, "Overall the issue was fine, and I'm curious to see where it all goes, but I'm far more eager to see what can be done with this grouping of  awesome female heroes once the wacky conceit of Secret Wars is over and they return to the Marvel Universe proper." Diaz also noted that, "[Marvel is] making a decidedly feminist statement by taking nearly all of their major female heroes and putting them together in their own Avengers title called A-Force."


==== Issue 2 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #2 was the 24th best selling comic book in July 2015.
Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources gave A-Force #2 a grade of 4 out of 5 stars, asserting "A-Force #2 appears to be a straightforward superheroine adventure on the surface but, as the pages turn, Bennett, Wilson, Molina, Yeung, Wong, Martin and Petit make it quite clear this isn't a straightforward anything. The mystery of the new arrival and whether or not the portals are hers would be enough but, embedded in the policies of Battleworld and the surrounding bureaucracy of it all, this story gets more personal. Easily dismissed as a gimmick, A-Force is anything but, packing in strong characters, smart characterization and wonderful artwork." Jeff Lake of IGN gave A-Force #2 a grade of 8 out of 10, saying "The first issue of A-Force provided a fine mix of boisterous action and engaging character work, all of which effectively tied into the larger Battleworld picture. Issue #2 offers much of the same, C. Willow Wilson and Marguerite Bennett both focusing the direction of the main narrative as they expand their characters place within it. The writers toss in magic portals and robot showdowns aplenty, but the real fun comes with their introduction of a mysterious new character. This unnamed entrant is interesting enough on her own, but becomes more so as we see how each A-Force member reacts around her. This new layer adds a welcome intrigue to Battleworld as a whole, as the team sets to unravel a mystery outside of their normal universe. Jorge Molina has a great time with the aforementioned newbie, his take silent but mischievous. His gift for nuanced expression again carries the book through its more emotional confrontations, not to mention he draws a pretty sweet battle sequence. -Jeff" Richard Gray of Newsarama gave A-Force #2  a grade of 8 out of 10, writing, "With the introduction of a new heroine and a new threat, the issue skillfully plays to the strengths of the ensemble, from She-Hulk's natural leadership, Medusa's ruthless decision making and former Runaway Nico Minoru's compassion."


==== Issue 3 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #3 was the 27th best selling comic book in August 2015.
C.K. Stewart of Newsarama gave A-Force #3 a grade of 8 out of 10, saying, "A-Force gets stronger with each passing issue, and the dramatic turns at the end of A-Force #3 make it the best issue yet." Jeff Lake of IGN gave A-Force #3 a grade of 7.3, saying, "A-Force finds itself in an interesting predicament here in issue #3. The inclusion of a mysterious traitor lends a needed sense of conflict to the book's events, but the lack of substantive development leaves that same reveal feeling slightly underserved. Perhaps it's partly because of the book's Secret Wars restraints, but as of yet the book's level of investment and development doesn't quite match its escalation. Thankfully, this is one example where the book's art is able to mask any narrative quibbles. Jorge Molina turns in another dynamite installment, his clean lines and powerful poses giving added life to C. Willow Wilson and Marguerite Bennett's script. The issue contains a number of standout moments, from dynamic splash pages to more contained emotional beats, and it's through Molina's whimsical, impish quality that the team's still unnamed "friend" remains so intriguing. There's still a lot of potential here, we just need a bit more event book freedom to see it realized." Marykate Jasper of Comic Book Resources gave A-Force #3 a grade of 3.5 out of 5 stars, asserting, "Altogether, A-Force still has a lot going for it, but the pacing is compounding the problems of its large cast. Luckily, issue #3 takes many of the necessary steps for ramping the pace back up, and I'm optimistic for issue #4."


==== Issue 4 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #4 was the 19th best selling comic book in September 2015.
David Pepose of Newsarama gave A-Force #4 a grade of 7 out of 10, saying, "It's a good thing this book looks so good, because the plot definitely feels flat, with the reveal of A-Force's traitor - and her endgame after being easily overcome - feels particularly undercooked." Levi Hunt of IGN gave A-Force #4 a 6.8 out of 10, asserting, "Jorge Molina's art is once again the best thing about A-Force as the series hits its least narratively satisfying issue. The underserved nature of the book's development has led to a conflict that has few real emotional stakes." Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave A-Force #4 a grade of 3 out of 5 stars, stating, "While A-Force #4 is not a bad comic, Marguerite Bennett, G. Willow Wilson, Jorge Molina, Craig Yeung and Walden Wong's latest installment clearly tries to get a lot of the exposition onto the table as the plot gears up for next month's conclusion, and that original sense of wonder and newness is greatly diminished as a result."


=== All-New, All-Different Marvel ===


==== Issue 1 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #1 was the 12th best selling comic book in January 2016.

David Pepose of Newsarama gave A-Force #1 a grade of 8 out of 10, stating, "While this book starts off with a shaky foundation - namely, that you have to have read a Secret Wars tie-in to understand where Singularity came from - Wilson does a great job at firming things up, with her new heroine proving to be a fun addition to the Marvel Universe." Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave A-Force #1 a grade of 3 out of 5 stars, writing, "Ultimately, I wish the narration from Singularity had been dropped entirely from "A-Force" #1. You can still understand what's going on without it, and the disparate clash of her thoughts and dialogue would have never happened. Hopefully, they will get smoothed out a bit in future issues, but—for now—this issue is only alright." Jeff Lake of IGN gave A-Force #1 a grade of 7.0 out of 10, asserting, "Overall, A-Force #1 is a solid, if unspectacular debut. It's great to see this cast together again, especially in the hands of Wilson, Molina and Martin, but as of now this new direction feels hamstrung by its need to square peg its way into a round hole."


==== Issue 2 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #2 was the 48th best selling comic book in February 2016.
Justin Partridge of Newsarama gave A-Force #2 a grade of 9 out of 10, saying, "A-Force #2 reads like a Sleater-Kinney song sounds: all confident bravado and a relentless pace. While the original series was inescapably tied to a company wide, Kelly Thompson, G. Willow Wilson, Jorge Molina and Laura Martin quickly cast off those ropes of continuity to let these ladies stand on their own and get down to the important work of punching weird stuff and giving each other sass." Jeff Lake of IGN gave A-Force #2 a grade of 8.5 out of 10, writing, "That's more like it. Following a passable but limited debut, A-Force takes a welcome leap courtesy of Kelly Thompson, G. Willow Wilson and Jorge Molina. At its core the issue is little more than an extension of the book's initial premise, with the universe-addled Singularity continuing to search for her long lost "friends". The difference here is that with the cast growing in size, Singularity is able to simply join the story without needing to drive it. This results in come excellent character play, as writers Thompson and Wilson jet-set their heroines around from misadventure to misadventure. There's such a great mix of personality here, from Medusa's regal above-it-all-air to Nico's rebellious indignation, and artist Molina captures each individual voice wonderfully. His physicality and expression is excellently nuanced, ensuring that no character looks or feels the same. When combined with another round of action packed visuals and pitch perfect humor, you get an issue much closer to the original series' spirit."


==== Issue 3 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #3 was the 53rd best selling comic book in March 2016.
Justin Partridge of Newsarama gave A-Force #3 a grade of 8 out of 10, asserting, "Writers Kelly Thompson and G. Willow Wilson continue the dazzling chemistry and tension between the team while at the same time keeping each woman's voice on point and selling Antimatter as a real threat to the team." Jeff Lake of IGN gave A-Force #3 a grade of 7.5  out of 10, saying, "Bucking the usual slow roll-out most super team books enjoy, A-Force's latest is again a high energy affair. Where last issue saw Kelly Thompson and G. Willow Wilson provide a welcome jump in character development and explored relationship dynamics, issue #3 offers a more action oriented focus." Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources gave A-Force #3 a grade of 3.5 out of 5 stars, stating, "A-Force #3 feels like a turning point for this ongoing series. With the team fully solidified, Kelly Thompson, G. Willow Wilson and Jorge Molina begin to show readers just how these established characters will work together, even as the relatively new Singularity continues to establish herself. Bit by bit, that early potential we saw in the "Secret Wars" tie-in starts to bear fruit in A-Force #3."


==== Issue 4 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #4 was the 67th best selling comic book in April 2016.
Marykate Jasper of Comic Book Resources gave A-Force #4 a grade of 4 out of 5 stars, saying, A-Force #4 gives readers the camaraderie, compassion and quips that they've come to love and expect from this series. Jeff Lake of IGN gave A-Force #4 a grade of 7.8 out of 10, stating, "In just four short issues Kelly Thompson and G. Willow Wilson have crafted a team rife with unique personalities, in turn creating an undeniable chemistry between them that makes their unfolding adventures ones worth investing in. Issue #4 only solidifies that fact, the conclusion to the Antimatter arc resulting in plenty of great moments both joint and character specific."


==== Issue 5 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #5 was the 60th best selling comic book in May 2016.
Greg McElhattan gave of Comic Book Resources gave A-Force #5 a grade of 4 out of 5 stars, asserting, "If A-Force #5 is any indication, the series is in good hands. Thompson, Caldwell and Herring's first issue together is fun and exciting, even as there are strong character and plot hooks to keep readers coming back for more."


==== Issue 6 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #6 was the 90th best selling comic book in June 2016.
Jeff Lake of IGN gave A-Force #6 a grade of 7.3 out of 10, saying, "When it comes to A-Force, the team's chemistry goes hand in hand with its success. Case in point – issue #6 is a solid, if unspectacular affair, with a familiar villain and a by the numbers plot. What makes the issue click is its fantastic characterization, writer Kelly Thompson continuing to build off of the great chemistry generated in the book's first arc."


==== Issue 7 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #7 was the 95th best selling comic book in July 2016.
Matthew Aguilar of ComicBook.com gave A-Force #7 a grade of 5 out of 5 stars, asserting, "A-Force continues to be a joy amongst my pull list every month, and I can't recommend it highly enough. It has hard hitting fights, snappy dialogue, and above all substantial character development for the entire cast. Sure it has some cheesy sentimentality every now and then, but it never feels dated or ham-fisted, and the book always seems to be in on the joke. You can't really do a team book any better."


=== Civil War II ===
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, A-Force #8 was the 101st best selling comic book in August 2016.

Jeff Lake of IGN gave A-Force #8 a grade of 7.0 out of 10, writing, "With a team consisting of Captain Marvel and Medusa, it was only a matter of time before the events of Civil War II made its way into A-Force. The ensuing tie-in has its share of hits and misses. Kelly Thompson's strong characterization remains intact, the rift of Civil War having its own unique effects on A-Force's tight-knit members. Thompson mines some great stuff from her cast as they argue their positions, with Dazzler really, er, dazzling as an opponent to Carol and Medusa's unwavering conviction. Unfortunately, the same quite can't be said of Nico, who gets the bulk of the issue's focus. While she does get some strong moments—her warm conversation with Misty Knight is an issue highlight—the way in which her story deviates feels entirely too manufactured, with an end that doesn't take a pre-cog to guess. Paulo Siqueira makes his mark as the new series artist, but ultimately this tie-in isn't quite possessing of the same charisma the series is known for."

=== A-FÜ ===
Teng Fu-ju (traditional Chinese: 鄧福如; simplified Chinese: 邓福如; pinyin: Dèng Fúrú; born 20 June 1987), known by her stage name A-FÜ (Chinese: 阿福; pinyin: Ā fú), is a Taiwanese singer and songwriter. Prior to her solo debut in the music scene, A-FÜ was a member of Lazy Bomb, an indie band, and a demo singer. She is known for her cover version of "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B and Bruno Mars, which drew wide attention on YouTube in 2010. In May 2011, A-FÜ released her debut studio album, That's How It Is, for which she received a nomination for Best New Artist at the 23rd Golden Melody Awards.


== Early life ==
Born in Hsinchu City on 20 June 1987, A-FÜ grew up in the countryside in Xiangshan District and in Changhua County. Both her parents run a rental car business together, and as they were often busy with work when she was young, A-FÜ and her elder sister, Hsing Ju, spent much of their childhood under the care of their aunt. Despite this, A-FÜ still maintains a close relationship with her mother and grew up influenced by her mother's love for music, in particular songs by Teresa Teng. At a young age, A-FÜ entered in singing and recitation competitions. Also, at her mother's request, she learned the standard Mandarin enunciation by watching the Taiwanese educational programme The Daily Characters (每日一字) hosted by news presenter Lee Yen-chiu, which perhaps, has shaped her distinctive vocals, in a way.
She attended Kuang-Fu High School, a comprehensive high school in Hsinchu, and graduated from Shih Hsin University with a degree in public relations and advertising in 2010.


== Career ==

During her college years, A-FÜ was the lead singer of an indie band called Lazy Bomb. The band released a self-titled EP in November 2007 and disbanded shortly after. Around this time, A-FÜ met music producer AL (何官錠), who is also a member and keyboard player of the pop rock band Six Plus (六甲樂團). She started collaborating with AL as a demo singer. The first demo which she recorded, titled "Sheng Sheng Man" (聲聲慢), was chosen as the ending theme song for the first season of the Chinese TV series Justice Bao. The Zhong guo feng music style of the song, coupled with A-FÜ's crystal-clear voice and diction, generated considerable buzz among the Chinese netizens. Soon after, A-FÜ's singing caught the attention of veteran host Chang Hsiao-yen, who later signed A-FÜ to her record label Forward Music. While awaiting the release of her debut album, A-FÜ garnered media attention after uploading her first video on YouTube in September 2010, her cover version of B.o.B and Bruno Mars's "Nothin' on You", which had racked up more than a million views within a week. She followed with more covers of popular hits, which includes "Bizarre Love Triangle",  "Qing Hua Ci" (青花瓷) by Jay Chou, Bruno Mars's "Just the Way You Are" and so forth. In December 2010, A-FÜ was featured as a backup singer during Stella Chang's comeback concert in Taiwan.
A-FÜ's debut album, That's How It Is, was released on 27 May 2011 and features a studio version of "Sheng Sheng Man" and her cover of "Nothin' on You". The album sold more than 25,000 copies in Taiwan within a month of its release. To further promote the album, A-FÜ performed a sold-out show at the Riverside Live House in Taipei on 25 June 2011, with Van Fan appearing as guest performer. On 3 July 2011, A-FÜ made a guest appearance at Jam Hsiao's mini-concert at Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf, performing "Just the Way You Are" and "Wei Tian Ci" (未填詞). In 2012, A-FÜ was nominated for Best New Artist at the 23rd Golden Melody Awards but lost to Ilid Kaolo.
Her next release, an extended play titled Happiness Is Around Us, was released on 7 March 2012. The second single off of the album, "Where Is The Love?", a self-composed track, was featured as an insert song in the drama series Big Red Riding Hood.
On 7 June 2013, A-FÜ released her second studio album, Sky Island, which debuted at number one on the Five Music Mandarin Album sales chart. It includes the track "Rang Wo Ai Shang Wo" (讓我愛上我) from the soundtrack album for the film Step Back to Glory (志氣). In May of that year, A-FÜ performed "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree" at Teresa Teng's memorial concert at Taipei Arena.
Her third studio album, Own Categories, was released on 19 June 2015. It features a duet, "Stop at the Crossing Ahead" (前面路口停), with Xiao Yu.


== Personal life ==
In January 2016, it was revealed that A-FÜ and YouTuber How How (Chen Tzu-hao) were in a relationship. The couple registered their marriage on 14 February 2019, and held their wedding ceremony in June the same year. Their son was born in January 2021.
In early April 2021, A-FÜ was accused of causing the breakup of the marriage of a manicurist and her husband, and also resulting in the manicurist's miscarriage. A-FÜ and her husband How How broke their silence on the accusation a week later, denying it and also revealing that they have engaged a lawyer to handle the allegations.

A-Grade Investments, LLC is a venture capital firm founded in 2010 by actor Ashton Kutcher, entertainment manager Guy Oseary, and billionaire investor Ron Burkle to invest in technology start-up companies. The company is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.


== Founding and partners ==

In 2012, Kutcher, Oseary and Burkle raised additional capital A-Grade from several billionaires, including David Geffen and Mark Cuban.
On May 1, 2013, onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC, Kutcher and Oseary confirmed rumors that the fund was valued at over $100 million.
In March 2016, Forbes published a comprehensive article on A-Grade Investments, entitled "How Ashton Kutcher And Guy Oseary Built A $250 Million Portfolio With Startups Like Uber And Airbnb," with Kutcher appearing on the cover of the magazine, which became the most-widely read issue in Forbes’ 99-year history.

=== A-Group culture ===
The A-Group was the first powerful society in Nubia, located in modern southern Egypt and northern Sudan that flourished between the First and Second Cataracts of the Nile in Lower Nubia. It lasted from the 4th millennium BC, reached its climax at c. 3100 BC, and fell 200 years later c. 2900 BC.


== Overview ==

In 1907, the Egyptologist George A. Reisner first discovered artifacts belonging to the A-Group culture. Reisner named this society the A-Group, which is now an outdated archaeological term, but remained in the literature. Early hubs of this civilization included Kubaniyya in the north and Buhen in the south, with Aswan, Sayala, Toshka and Qustul in between.
The A-Group population was once described as ethnically “very similar” to the pre-dynastic Egyptians in physical characteristics, although this view is considered largely outdated, with the A-Group now considered of having been closely related to Sub-Saharan and North African populations. The A-Group maintained commercial ties with the Ancient Egyptians. They traded raw materials like incense, ebony and ivory, which were gathered from the southern riverine area. They also bartered carnelian from the Western Desert as well as gold mined from the Eastern Desert in exchange for Egyptian craft products, olive oil, and other items from the Mediterranean basin.
A-Group dwellings consisted mostly of reed huts and rock shelters, with most settlements taking the form of temporary settlements and pastoralist communities. A substantial A-Group settlement is at the site of Afyeh in Lower Nubia, where the remains of houses with stone foundation slabs have also been found. The location, architecture, and material culture of Afyeh, along with its uniqueness in Nubia, suggest that it may have been an Egyptian (Naqadian) outpost.
A-Group Nubians were semi-nomadic herders and rudimentary agriculturalists who also practised extensive fishing, hunting and gathering. Evidence of agriculture first appears in the Terminal A-Group period, c. 3200-3000 BC (contemporary with Naqada IIIB).


== Social Organization ==
Ceramic decorative motifs conserved among the A-Group and the settlement at Kadero, located northeast of Khartoum, suggests that the two groups were influenced by one another, whether directly or indirectly through trade with Egypt. Additionally, the existence of an elite group in Kadero parallels the evidence of an elite group within the A-Group.
Cemetery L at Qustul provides evidence of an elite burial, containing nearly 200 pottery vessels, some containing expensive imports from Egypt and Palestine.
There is little evidence outside of Cemetery L to suggest social stratification of the A-Group. However, there is evidence that the A-Group moved from a pastoralist society to a more sedentary society by the end of the 4th millennium BC, which could suggest that the conditions were right to develop more complex social organization.


== A-Group Pottery ==
The two main types of pottery created during the A-Group period were eggshell ceramics and black-topped red ware. Eggshell ceramics are characterized by their eggshell-thin walls. Black-topped red ware pottery was created by oxidizing the clay, rich in iron, creating the distinctive red color. Subsequently, the rim was dipped in sawdust to cut off oxygen supply, creating the "black-topped" rim. 


== Cemeteries L, V, and W of Qustul and Debate About the Origins of Dynastic Egypt ==
Almost all knowledge about the A-Group comes from cemeteries, as few settlements have been excavated. Cemetery L is a royal cemetery dating back to the A-Group, and excavated by archaeologist Bruce Williams. Cemetery L contains tombs of rulers and high officials, Cemetery V contains tombs of other officials, and Cemetery W exclusively contains burials of people with lesser status. Excavations at Cemetery L yielded an incense burner, which was adorned with ancient Egyptian royal iconography. Williams asserted that the royal monarchy of Egypt originated in Qustul. He based his reasoning on Cemetery L from three archaeological finds: the size of the tombs, their expensive contents, and royal iconography (such as pottery vessels and stone censers), however, further research established the antecedence of the predynastic Egyptian regalia: 

The earliest known examples of Egyptian royal iconography, such as, e.g., the representation of the Red Crown on a late Naqada I (c. 3500 BC) pottery vessel from Abydos or the triumphal scenes in the painting from Hierakonpolis Tomb 100 (c. 3400-3300 BC) are much older than the Qustul censer. It seems thus that it was the Qustul rulers who adopted symbols of royal authority developed in Egypt and not vice versa.
Furthermore, Williams received backlash from William Y. Adams and Maria Carmela Gatto. Gatto argued that Bruce Williams explicitly denied making such a sweeping claim, saying that he was only trying to raise the possibility that dynastic Egypt originated near Qustul, and Nubia facilitated that process. Gatto additionally referenced the Red Crown from the late Naqada I vessel, referenced above, claiming that Nubia almost certainly did not play a pivotal role in the rise of the Egyptian monarchy. While she also mentions that the tombs found in Qustul were comparable to that of Egyptian ruler's tombs, William Y. Adams suggests that the large size and contents of their grave support a different story than the one Williams paints, relating back to social stratification. He states that the large tombs and their contents provide evidence for a stratified society, one that archaeologists previously had not envisioned in the A-group period. He claims that this evidence cannot be extended and correlated to the Egyptian monarchy. Adams also argues that the Qustul incense burner found in the cemetery may be better suited to prove that the monarchy was situated somewhere near the Nile Valley instead of the monarchy being initially situated in Nubia.


== Tracing the A-Group ==
From excavations at A-Group cemeteries, archaeologists have been tracing the genetic and ancestral lineage between A-Group Nubians and other societies. The specimens found in A-Group cemeteries typically had hair of a black or dark brown hue. On average, the men were 169.9 cm in height and the women stood around 155.5 cm. Some individuals were wrapped in leather and positioned on reed mats. All of the tombs contained various burial items, including personal ornaments, utensils and ceramics.
According to a study of Nubian dental affinities by Joel Irish in 2005, traits characterizing Late Paleolithic samples from Nubia are common in recent populations south of the Sahara, whereas traits shared by Final Neolithic and later Nubians more closely emulate those found among groups originating to the north, i.e. in Egypt and, to a diminishing degree, greater North Africa, West Asia, and Europe. Irish concluded that genetic discontinuity occurred in Nubia sometime after the late Pleistocene.
Dental trait analysis of A-Group fossils found affinities with populations inhabiting Northeast Africa, the Nile valley, and East Africa. Among the sampled populations, the A-Group people were nearest to the Kerma culture bearers, Kush populations in Upper Nubia, and to Ethiopians. This is followed by the Meroitic, X-Group and Christian period inhabitants of Lower Nubia and the Kellis population in the Dakhla Oasis, as well as C-Group and Pharaonic era skeletons excavated in Lower Nubia and ancient Egyptians (Naqada, Badari, Hierakonpolis, Abydos and Kharga in Upper Egypt; Hawara in Lower Egypt).
In 2020, Kanya Godde analysed a series of crania which included two Egyptian (predynastic Badarian and Naqada series), a series of A-Group Nubians, and a Bronze Age series from Lachish, Palestine. The two pre-dynastic series had strongest affinities, followed by closeness between the Naqada and the Nubian series. Further, the Nubian A-Group plotted nearer to the Egyptians, and the Lachish sample placed more closely to Naqada than Badari. According to Godde, the spatial-temporal model applied to the pattern of biological distances explains the more distant relationship of Badari to Lachish than Naqada to Lachish, as gene flow will cause populations to become more similar over time. Overall, both Egyptian samples included were more similar to the Nubian series than to the Lachish series.


== Comparative A-Group Culture ==
More recent and broader studies have determined that the distinct pottery styles, differing burial practices, different grave goods and the distribution of sites all indicate that the Naqada people and the Nubian A-Group people were from different cultures. Kathryn Bard further states that "Naqada cultural burials contain very few Nubian craft goods, which suggests that while Egyptian goods were exported to Nubia and were buried in A-Group graves, A-Group goods were of little interest further north."
Nubian excavations in Serra East found that the bodies buried in the A-Group cemeteries would lay on either side with their head facing south or east. Similar to that of a curled-up position, their hands could be found near the face and their legs folded-in upwards. Leather wrappings were also found in the burials as a means of clothing and bags. However, this leather wrapping was not typically found in more lavish cemeteries, such as Cemetery L at Qustul. As for distinct pottery styles, decorative vessels were more likely to be found in larger tombs at Qustul, whereas simpler burial arrangements contained ripple-burnished or simple vessels. However, the archaeological cemeteries at Qustul are no longer available for excavations since the flooding of Lake Nasser.
According to David Wengrow, the A-Group polity of the late 4th millenninum BC is poorly understood since most of the archaeological remains are submerged underneath Lake Nasser.

Frank Yurco stated that depictions of pharonic iconography such as the royal crowns, Horus falcons and victory scenes were concentrated in the Upper Egyptian Naqada culture and A-Group Nubia. He further elaborated that:"Egyptian writing arose in Naqadan Upper Egypt and A-Group Nubia, and not in the Delta cultures, where the direct Western Asian contact was made, further vititates the Mesopotamian-influence argument".
Oshiro Michinori argued, in reference to the A-Group culture, that the external influence from Nubia on the formation of Ancient Egypt in the pre-dynastic period to the dynasty period predates influence from eastern Mesopotamia.  He notes an increase in the appreciation of the contribution of Nubia in the south to Ancient Egyptian culture at the time of his writing.  According to him, chiefs of the same cultural level as Upper Egyptian powers existed in Lower Nubia and exhibited pharaonic iconography before the unification of Egypt.


== Existence of the B-Group ==
It was originally determined by Reisner that the A-Group culture came to an end around 3100 BC, when it was destroyed by the First Dynasty rulers of Egypt. Reisner originally identified a B-Group and C-Group culture that existed within Nubia following the fall of the A-Group. However, the B-group theory became obsolete when Henry S. Smith demonstrated from funerary evidence that it was an impoverished manifestation of the A-Group culture while the culture was starting to disintegrate. With the existential crisis of the B-Group, it is suggested that these burials were simply poorer versions of A-group burials and that the span of the A-group culture lasted beyond 3100 BC.

=== A-H-S-T Community School District ===
A-H-S-T Community School District was a school district headquartered in Avoca, Iowa.
The district served sections of Harrison, Pottawattamie, and Shelby counties. It served Avoca, Hancock, Shelby, and much of Tennant.


== History ==
It was formed by the merger of the Hancock-Avoca Community School District and the Shelby Community School District on July 1, 1996.
In 2012 the A-H-S-T district and the Walnut Community School District began partial-day-sharing, in which students went to one school for some courses, as well as sharing of athletic programs. In 2014 the district began whole grade-sharing, in one school district sent its children to another school district to attend schools there all day.
Circa 2015 the middle school area of the AHSTW Secondary School building in Avoca was scheduled to receive an expansion.
The election for the school district merger was scheduled for September 8, 2015 after the Green Hills Area Education Agency approved of the merger proposal and election. The vote was approved by 94% of the voters within A-H-S-T and 77% of those in Walnut, with a combined total of 614 for and 74 against. On July 1, 2016, the A-H-S-T district merged with the Walnut district to form the AHSTW Community School District.

== Plot ==
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are wandering vagabonds in Arizona countryside who are arrested for loitering and spend a night in jail. Upon release, they are instructed to leave town immediately due to lacking transportation. They agree to escort a coffin, containing a corpse, to Dayton, Ohio, believing it offers them free transport.
Unaware that their employers, Frank Lucas and Joe Morgan, are gangsters working for Darby Mason, a wanted criminal, Stan and Oliver load Mason's trunk onto a train, mistaking it for another trunk belonging to a magician named Dante. Along the journey, they fall victim to confidence men and are left penniless until Dante assists them financially.
Upon arrival in Dayton, confusion arises as the trunks are mixed up, leading to mistaken identities. Mason's trunk is sent to the theater where Dante performs, while Dante's trunk is delivered to a sanatorium. As events unfold, confusion ensues at the theater, with mistaken identities and suspicions mounting.
Investigator Steve Barnes, disguised as attorney Kilgore, reveals the inheritance search as a trap to capture Mason. Trapped in the theater's basement with his accomplices, Mason confesses to a murder. Meanwhile, Ollie continues his search for Stan, finding him apparently shrunken by magic.

A-Haunting We Will Go is a 1966 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on April 16, 1966, and stars Daffy Duck, Speedy Gonzales and Witch Hazel.


== Plot ==
During Halloween, Daffy Duck's nephew, dressed as a witch, goes trick-or-treating and visits Witch Hazel's house. Terrified by her appearance, he runs home to tell Daffy, who dismisses his fears and decides to prove that witches do not exist by visiting Hazel himself.
Meanwhile, Witch Hazel, lamenting her constant work, seeks a stand-in so she can take a vacation. She transforms Speedy Gonzales into her double using a special piece of cheese. Although Speedy retains his usual energetic behavior, Hazel deems it acceptable and leaves for Hawaii.
When Daffy arrives at Hazel's house, Speedy, disguised as Hazel, serves him tea made from potions, turning Daffy into a flower-headed creature. Hazel returns, reverts Speedy to his mouse form, and considers cooking Daffy for dinner. She transforms Daffy back to his original state, but he escapes, only to find himself parachuting with an anvil after jumping from her broomstick.
Back on the ground, Daffy is frightened by his nephew, still in his witch costume. He reassures his nephew that witchcraft is mere superstition, unaware that he has once again turned into the flower-headed creature on their way home.

=== A-Hmao ===
A-Hmao, also known as Big Flowery Miao (Chinese: 大花苗), are a Hmongic ethnic group in China. They are from Yunnan and Sichuan and also live in Guizhou. The number of persons within this group likely exceeds 400,000. They are speakers of the A-Hmao language, which belongs to the Hmong family.

=== A-Hmao language ===
The A-Hmao (or Ahmao) language, also known as Large Flowery Miao (pinyin: Dà Huā Miáo), Hua Miao, or Northeast Yunnan Miao (Chinese: 苗语滇东北方言; pinyin: Miáoyǔ Diàndōngběi fāngyán), is a Hmongic language spoken in China. It is the language the Pollard script was designed for, and displays extensive tone sandhi. There is a high degree of literacy in Pollard among the older generation.
The standard written language, both in Pollard and in Latin script, is that of Shíménkǎn (石门坎) village in Weining County.


== Classification ==
The A-Hmao language is a branch of the West Hmongic languages, also known as Chuanqiandian Miao (Chinese: 川黔滇苗; lit. 'Sichuan–Guizhou–Yunnan Miao') and Western Miao, which is a major branch of the Hmongic languages of China and Southeast Asia.
Wang Fushi (1985) grouped the Western Miao languages into eight primary divisions:

Chuanqiandian Miao
Northeast Yunnan Miao (A-Hmao language)
Guiyang Miao
Huishui Miao
Mashan Miao
Luobohe Miao
Chong'anjiang Miao
Pingtang Miao


== Geographic distribution ==
The A-Hmao language is spoken in the northeast of Yunnan Province and in the west of Guizhou Province, particularly in Zhaotong, Kunming, Qujing, Chuxiong Yi autonomous prefecture, Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao autonomous county, Hezhang county, Liupanshui, and Ziyun Miao and Buyi autonomous county. There are 300,000 native speakers. The standard dialect is that of Shimenkan (石门坎),  Weining County (威宁县).


== Phonology ==


=== Consonants ===

Moreover, Gerner (2022) treats breathiness as a property of the onset, such as [lʱ] in the word lif [lʱi11] 'two', and reports a fricative aspirated lateral [ɬʰ], as in the word [ɬʰi11] 'become'.


=== Vowels ===


=== Tones ===

On the basis of the eight tones of A-Hmao, in the eastern region, the fourth, sixth, and eighth tones are broken up partially or entirely into two categories.  At most, there can be up to eleven tones.  Essentially, nouns and quantifiers are part of the first category, and they are higher in pitch. Other word classes are part of the second category, and they are lower in pitch.
The A-Hmao language displays extensive tone sandhi. Similar to other branches of the West Hmongic languages, the tone sandhi happens on the second syllable when the first syllable of a disyllable word is level tone (first and second tone).


== Grammar ==


=== Morphology and vocabulary ===
The morphology of the three branches of the Hmong language is basically the same. The following examples are from Central Miao. A-Hmao is similar to Hmong, which is an isolating language in which most morphemes are monosyllables. As a result, verbs are not overtly inflected. Tense, aspect, mood, person, number, gender, and case are indicated lexically.
Single-morpheme word

Monosyllable single-morpheme word. (single-morpheme words are mostly monosyllable in Hmong language)

==== Classifier inflections ====
One unusual feature of A-Hmao morphology is the existence of inflecting classifiers, i.e., classifiers that change form.


=== Syntax ===
As with other Hmongic languages, the basic word order of A-Hmao is SVO. Within the noun phrase, possessors precede possessed nouns, while relative clauses precede the nouns they modify. Noun phrases have the form as  (possessive) + (quantifier) + (classifier) + noun + (adjective) + (demonstrative). Question formation in Ahmao does not involve word order change: question words generally remain in situ, rather than appear in sentence-initial position, and pseudo-clefting is also generally used in questions.


==== Overview ====
A-Hmao exhibits the grammatical patterns as in the table below.


==== Question formation ====
Questions are typically formed with the wh- question word in situ, i.e., it appears where the corresponding noun would in the sentence, rather than appear sentence-initially:


== Writing system ==
The A-Hmao have no indigenous writing system. In the beginning of the 20th century, missionary Samuel Pollard invented the Pollard script, which was based on the decorative symbols on their clothing. Before the introduction of the Pollard script, the A-Hmao people recorded their history through their ancient songs and weaving the history of their memories on their clothes. Those images formed a history of the A-Hmao.

=== A-Hunting We Will Go ===
"A-Hunting We Will Go" is a popular folk song and nursery rhyme composed in 1777 by English composer Thomas Arne. Arne had composed the song for a 1777 production of The Beggar's Opera in London. 
The a- is an archaic intensifying prefix; compare "Here We Come A-wassailing/Here We Come A-caroling" and lyrics to "The Twelve Days of Christmas" (e.g., “Six geese a-laying”).

=== A-I-R Atos ===
The A-I-R Atos is a German high-wing, single-place, rigid wing hang glider designed by Felix Ruehle and produced by A-I-R GmbH of Halblech.


== Design and development ==
The Atos was originally designed as a competition rigid wing hang glider in 1998, with production commencing the following year. Since then the design has undergone almost continuous refinement and a succession of model numbers. It remained in production in 2012.
The aircraft structure is made from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer. The wing uses minimal cable bracing and incorporates both flaps and spoilers for roll control. The aspect ratio for most models is in the range of 11:1 or 12:1. Achieved glide ratios run as high as 20:1. Later models incorporate a horizontal tailplane for improved stability.
The Atos gliders are designed for folding for ground transportation. The largest model, the Atos VX, for example, can be folded into 5.80 x 0.48 x 0.20m (19.0 x 1.57 x 0.66 feet) in 18 minutes and weighs 47.5 kg (105 lb).
Later model Atos are compatible with the Swedish Aerosport Mosquito power pack.
The wing was also later developed into an ultralight trike, the Ultralight Design Atos Trike. It can also be fitted to the Veleria Dedalo Strike-T trike.


== Operational history ==
The Atos series have been flown in the rigid wing class in World Hang Gliding Championships since 1999 and have won titles on many occasions.


== Variants ==

=== A-Imdugud ===
A-Imdugud (𒀀𒀭𒅎𒂂 ADIM.DUGUDMUŠEN, named after God Imdugud, also read Aja-Anzu; fl. c. 2600 BC), was an early ruler of the First Dynasty of Ur in the 27th century BCE. He does not appear in the Sumerian King List, but is known from an inscribed seal found in tomb PG 1236 in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, which is the largest and probably the earliest tomb structure at the cemetery.


== Tomb ==
Several artefacts are known from tomb PG 1236, a twin tomb at the Royal Cemetery at Ur, although the tomb was robbed in the past. Two inscribed seals were found, one is a banquet scene with an inscription Gan-Ekiga(k), and another with the depiction of a nude hero fighting lions and a war scene reminiscent of the Standard of Ur, with the name Aja-Anzu, also read A-Imdugud. This seals is very similar to the seal of Mesannepada. Gold leaves with embossed designs, as well as a reconstituted gold scepter, have also been found in the tomb.

=== A-Jacks ===
A-Jacks are a commercially made concrete product used in both open channel and coastal applications. They consist of two concrete T-shaped pieces joined perpendicularly at the middle, forming six legs. They are a product owned and patented worldwide by Poseidon Alliance Ltd. 


== Applications ==
Open channel applications include bank stabilization, flow and grade control, scour protection for bridge piers, and biostabilization. The primary mechanism of protection employed is an increase in the relative roughness of the channel bank (as characterized by the Manning's Roughness Coefficient); the Manning's n is relatively high at 0.1. The advantage of A-Jacks over other hard armoring solutions is the comparatively large area available in the interstitial spaces for native vegetation to take root, ultimately helping to restore the stream bank to a more natural state while continuing to protect against erosion.
In coastal applications A-Jacks are used as breakwaters, revetments, artificial reefs, and habitat development. In breakwater applications, A-Jacks can be an economical alternative to quarried rock, which can be both heavier and unwieldy; over the course of a breakwater construction project, the number of transportation cycles to deliver product to the site can be reduced substantially, since A-Jacks are delivered flat on trucks whereas rock rip-rap would be brought in dump trucks. For example, rock can weigh between 150-175 lb; a suitable rip-rap boulder comparable to a 96 inch A-Jacks unit (about 36 cubic feet) would weigh about 5800 pounds, about 16% more than the A-Jacks unit. A-Jacks also have the advantage of being interlocking and self-stabilizing. For artificial reefs and habitat development, typical reef-building biota find areas of low turbulence within the open spaces to establish colonies.

=== A-Jax (band) ===
A-Jax (Korean: 에이젝스, stylized in all caps) was a South Korean boy band formed by DSP Media in 2012. Early in their career, the group was known as DSP Boyz but then was changed to A-Jax. The group's final lineup was composed of five members: Hyeongkon, Yunyoung, Seungjin, Seungyeop, and Junghee. They made the first appearance on TV as a group on MBC Music's Making the Star – DSP Boyz on April 24, 2012. The group made its official debut with the single "One 4 U" in South Korea on June 1 and in Japan on August 8, 2012 with the same song.


== History ==


=== Pre-debut ===
The debut of the group was announced on April 1, 2012 with a video teaser of their MBC Music's show Making the Star. During that time, they were temporarily called as 'DSP Boyz'. More teasers of the show were revealed during the time on DSP Media's YouTube account, the second on April 4, the third on April 9 and the last on April 12. On April 13, the group signed a two-year contract as endorsement models for the sports casual brand Spris.

Sungmin's on April 20. Seungyeop and Hyeongkon's on April 22. Seungjin's on April 23.
DSP Media announced the group's official name as "A-Jax" on April 24 and DSP also explained the meaning of the group's name: "A-Jax is in reference to the mythological Greek hero that helped bring victory to the Greeks during the Trojan War." On May 7, a mysterious video featuring KARA's member Goo Hara was revealed on DSP Media's YouTube account with a male voice in the background. The video created a confusion because it was not revealed if the video was a teaser for an upcoming Korean comeback of KARA, or a teaser for an upcoming solo event of Hara, or something related to A-Jax. On May 10, another video of Hara was released, revealing that the teaser was related to A-Jax. In the teaser, a song of the group (at this time the name was not revealed) was playing at the background. On May 15, DSP Media released the song and music video of the song played on the teaser, called "Never Let Go". On the music video only appears Hara. Later it was stated that the song was only a prologue song.
On May 21, it was revealed that A-Jax was set to be the opening act in KARA's last two shows of their first tour, Karasia, in Saitama, Japan. The members stated "It's an honor to be able to stand on such a big stage before our debut. It'll be a learning experience for us. As it is a great opportunity, we're going to work to show as much of our charm as possible."


=== 2012: Debut with One 4 U and 2MYX ===

On May 1, it was revealed that the group will be debuting in South Korea and Japan simultaneously in 2012. It was also revealed by DSP that "A-Jax will be the first Korean idol group to debut within Korea and Japan simultaneously, and will follow in the footsteps of the group SS501. A-Jax has signed under the equivalent conditions that other Korean male idol groups, who have already established their popularity, have been given, making it an unprecedented event. Thus, they are receiving much attention from Japanese music industry insiders." For their Japanese releases, they signed with the label Universal Sigma, where their labelmates Kara and Rainbow are currently signed.
On May 28, DSP Media released, on A-Jax's YouTube account, a teaser of the music video for their official debut song "One 4 U".

The group made its official debut on TV music shows on MBC's Show! Music Core on June 2, with the songs  "Never Let Go" (used as opening) and "One 4 U". On June 4, it was stated that the group will perform on Japan's a-nation, along with the artists/groups AAA, Aaron, Breathe, Da Pump, Deep, Daichi Miura, Shu-I, U-KISS and 4ever. The event will be held in Yoyogi on August 9.
On June 19, Universal Sigma announced that "One 4 U" was re-recorded in Japanese and will be released as their debut single in Japan. The single will be released on August 8, 2012. It was also announced that the group will make a Handshake event commemorating the release of the single.

On July 17, A-Jax's fan-cafe was updated with the group's fan name, to be titled "A-Light". On August 9, Universal Sigma announced that "Hot Game" was re-recorded in Japanese and will be released as the group's second Japanese single, to be released on October 31, 2012.
The group released their debut mini album titled 2MYX on November 15. The EP includes three new songs and the songs already released in South Korea, "One 4 U", "Never Let Go" and "Hot Game".


=== 2013–2019: Insane, Snake, Lineup changes, and disbandment ===

=== A-Jax (video game) ===
A-Jax (エー・ジャックス) is a vertically scrolling shooter released in arcades by Konami in December 1987. There was a European release of the game called Typhoon, which is the name used for Imagine Software's ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64 ports.
The players control a "Tom Tiger" helicopter (in the 2D stage) and later a "Jerry Mouse" fighter jet (in the 3D stage), and shoot enemies in the air and bomb them on the ground, collecting power-ups and defeating bosses to advance levels.


== Gameplay ==

The game takes place in a fictional 2007, where an unnamed nuclear superpower had been working with aliens to construct an artificial planetoid. However, the aliens betrayed and invaded the superpower, cutting off all communication with the rest of the world, then beginning a conquest of the planet. Determined to prevent the aliens from using the planetoid to deploy nuclear weapons with impunity, the United Nations deploy the elite strike force A-Jax to cripple the alien campaign and destroy the planetoid.
The player combats the occupation forces using vehicles under operation code named 'A-Jax' created to liberate the Earth. Game play is divided into two scrolling sections with two different vehicles: the first being a vertical scrolling section with the helicopter and a rail scrolling stage with the jet/space fighter. The game spans eight stages and extends to 30,000 points, a second at 150,000 points.
During the helicopter segments, the player has access to four different weapons air-to-air weapons (Vulcan, 3-Way, Triple, Laser) and air-to-ground bombs. Each air-to-air weapon is available through their own specific pick-up icon, while picking up a B upgrades the bombs' speed and power. However, the helicopter can only equip one air-to-air weapon at a time, with the Bomb being constant. The player also has access to Options which add additional firepower. The jet segments contrast highly from the helicopter segments--they have a complete lack of available power-ups and additional weapons beyond a machine gun and bomb.


== Reception ==
In Japan, Game Machine listed A-Jax on their January 15, 1988 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

=== A-Jay Leitch-Smith ===
Jay Leitch-Smith (born 6 March 1990), known as A-Jay Leitch-Smith, is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Northern Premier League Division One West club Hanley Town.
A graduate of the Academy at Crewe Alexandra, he played on loan for Halifax Town, Newcastle Town, ÍBV (Iceland), and Curzon Ashton. He spent six years with Crewe, winning the League Two play-offs in 2012 and the Football League Trophy in 2013. He signed with Yeovil Town in June 2014 but moved on to Port Vale in July 2015 after a poor season with Yeovil. He finished as Port Vale's top-scorer before moving on to Shrewsbury Town in June 2016. He joined Scottish Premiership club Dundee on loan for the 2017–18 season. He signed with Morecambe in August 2018 and remained with the club for three seasons. He joined National League side Altrincham in August 2021 and moved on to Warrington Rylands via Nantwich Town in 2022. He joined Hyde United for a brief spell on loan in March 2023. He rejoined Nantwich the following season before a switch to Stafford Rangers and then Hanley Town.


== Career ==


=== Crewe Alexandra ===
Whilst on the books at Crewe Alexandra as a youth player, Leitch-Smith was loaned out to non-League clubs Halifax Town in November 2008 and Newcastle Town in March 2009. He signed his first professional contract in April 2009, before joining Icelandic club ÍBV on loan. He was recalled from his loan, along with Chris Clements, in early September due to injury problems at Crewe.
He made his League Two debut for Crewe at Gresty Road in a 3–2 defeat to Bury on 29 September 2009, replacing Joel Grant as a substitute in the 80th minute. This was his only appearance of the 2009–10 season. He joined Curzon Ashton on loan in March 2010. He scored seven goals in ten Northern Premier League appearances, which was enough to win him a new contract at Crewe.
He scored his first goal in the English Football League on 21 August 2010, adding the final goal of the "Railwaymen's" 7–0 win over Barnet. However, he was limited to only 18 appearances in the 2010–11 season as he struggled to step up to first-team football, and manager Dario Gradi devised a special pre-season fitness programme in the summer to help him to adapt to senior football.
Leitch-Smith scored nine goals in 44 games in the 2011–12 campaign. He signed a new one-year contract in April 2012, and manager Steve Davis stated, "I'd like to think that he can become the 15 to 20 goal a season man we need." On 27 May, he played the first 85 minutes of the League Two play-off final victory over Cheltenham Town at Wembley Stadium, providing the assist for Byron Moore's goal which secured the 2–0 victory and Crewe's promotion into League One.
He scored six goals in 35 matches in the 2012–13 season. On 7 April he made another appearance at Wembley, as the Alex beat Southend United 2–0 in the Football League Trophy final; he was an 83rd-minute substitute for Max Clayton. The next month he signed a one-year extension to his existing contract. However, he played just 24 games in the 2013–14 season, scoring two goals. He left Crewe after an eleven-year association with his hometown club, saying he felt like a "part of the furniture" of the club.


=== Yeovil Town ===
In June 2014, Leitch-Smith signed for Gary Johnson's League One club Yeovil Town on a two-year contract. He struggled in his first season for the "Glovers", as he was played mostly in a wide position. He only scored twice in 38 appearances. He was one of four players offered a contract termination by new manager Paul Sturrock following Yeovil's relegation into League Two at the end of the season.


=== Port Vale ===
In July 2015, Leitch-Smith signed a 12-month deal with League One side Port Vale after agreeing to leave Yeovil. He earned the contract after impressing manager Rob Page during pre-season training. He scored his first goal for the "Valiants" on 14 November, with a header that opened the scoring in a 2–1 win at Barnsley. This was to start a sequence of five goals in four games, which was the best scoring run of his career to that point. For his performances he was short-listed for the League One player of the month award. After scoring his sixth goal of the season in a 1–1 draw with Scunthorpe United at Vale Park on 12 December he was named in the Football League Paper's team of the day. He scored four goals in four games in January to go into double figures for the season to earn himself a nomination for the PFA fans' Player of the Month award for League One. Chairman Norman Smurthwaite confirmed that Leitch-Smith had rejected the offer of a new contract from the club in May 2016.


=== Shrewsbury Town ===
Leitch-Smith signed with League One side Shrewsbury Town in June 2016, along with former Port Vale teammates Ryan McGivern and Louis Dodds. He scored his first goal for the club in the first minute of a first-round League Cup tie against Championship side Huddersfield Town, with Shrewsbury going on to win 2–1. After an indifferent run of form in Micky Mellon's last weeks as manager, he was recalled to the starting eleven by new manager Paul Hurst for an FA Cup first round tie on 5 November, and scored the second goal in a 3–0 victory over Barnet. He was limited to five goals in 12 starts and nine substitute appearances throughout the 2016–17 campaign, and was not allocated a squad number ahead of the following season as he was not in the club's future plans.
On 31 August 2017, he joined Scottish Premiership club Dundee on a five-month loan deal. He made his debut for the "Dee" on 9 September, coming on as a 38th-minute substitute for Scott Allan in a 4–1 defeat at Rangers. He was given his first start at Dens Park seven days later, scoring twice in a 3–2 win over St Johnstone. In January 2018, the loan agreement was extended to the end of the 2017–18 season after "Dee" manager Neil McCann was impressed by the link-up play he made with striker Sofien Moussa despite him being unable to secure a regular place in the starting eleven. He was released by Shrewsbury at the end of the 2017–18 season.


=== Morecambe ===
On 8 August 2018, Leitch-Smith signed a one-year contract with League Two side Morecambe; manager Jim Bentley stated that he had "tried to sign him a couple of years ago." He scored six goals in 29 appearances for the "Shrimps" in the 2018–19 season, having missed the second half of the campaign with a hamstring tear. Despite only scoring six goals and missing half the season he ended the campaign as the club's top-scorer and went on to sign a new two-year contract at the Globe Arena. However, he was restricted to just eight league starts in the 2019–20 season before football was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England. He played just seven times in the 2020–21 promotion season, scoring one goal, and was released at the end of his contract.


=== Non-League ===
On 7 August 2021, Leitch-Smith joined National League side Altrincham. He said that the attractive football played at Moss Lane reminded him of his time at Crewe. He made just four starts during the 2021–22 season, though made a further 15 substitute appearances and scored four goals, claiming one assist.
In July 2022, Leitch-Smith returned to his native Cheshire to join Northern Premier League Premier Division side Nantwich Town. He scored two goals in sixteen games for the "Dabbers". In November 2022, Leitch-Smith signed for league rivals Warrington Rylands. He joined Hyde United on loan in March 2023. He scored one goal in five games for Hyde.
Leitch-Smith returned to Nantwich Town on 11 August 2023, and made 11 appearances during the early part of the 2023–24 season, scoring four goals, before leaving to join Stafford Rangers. He left the field injured as Stafford lost 1–0 to Ashton United at Marston Road as relegation from the Northern Premier League Premier Division was confirmed. He switched to divisional rivals Hanley Town in October 2024. He featured 20 times in the 2024–25 campaign, scoring two goals, as the club suffered relegation.


== Style of play ==
Though Leitch-Smith lacks natural athleticism and pace, he is an intelligent and creative attacker with good technical skills and a high work rate. Former teammate Tom Pope stated that Leitch-Smith was "one of the most intelligent strikers... in League One".

These events include panels with American authors and artists, a console gaming room, tabletop gaming room,  cosplay, scavenger hunts, martial arts demonstrations, an art show, and concerts by Japanese and SteamPunk bands.  The convention also maintains a vigorous social network presence on Facebook and Twitter, having about 15,000 and 7,000 followers respectively, through which they post information and run contests throughout the year.


== History ==
The name seems to be a play on the early anime series Project A-ko. A-Kon 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A-Kon 2021 was also cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A-Kon 2024 was postponed due to various issues including financial problems.

Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating writing that Gardner's voice is "rich, manly and blessed with an intriguing hint of huskiness to it." The tune was described as "a glossy-yet-gloomy electropop affair, and very much a grower not a shower."
Fraser McAlpine of BBC Chart Blog described the song as pleasant though unmemorable background music that is "neither so offensively irksome to my refined palate that I'm tempted to smash the speakers, or so astonishingly mind-sparklingly brilliant that my productivity shoots through the floor." He follows on to criticise the repetitive nature of the whole affair with "After the first minute or so, nothing happens. We just go round and around on the same eight bar of well-mannered, polite synthpop. Oh sure, there's a breakdown section, but it's not particularly arresting and comes across as a transparent attempt to break things up and then drum up some interest in the return of that bassline again"
To help promote the album, Gardner was one of the support acts for Pixie Lott's 'The Crazy Cats Tour' starting in November 2010. However, the album was never released and Gardner was ultimately dropped from his label.


=== Re-emergence as A-L-X (2014) ===
In 2014, Gardner updated his Twitter account to reflect his new stage name, A-L-X and performed his new single "Beautiful Criminal" as a BBC Introducing act at Radio 1's Big Weekend.

=== A-Lad-In Bagdad ===
A-Lad-In Bagdad is a 1938 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies short directed by Cal Howard and Cal Dalton. The short was released on August 27, 1938 and features Egghead.


== Plot ==
Egghead is a happy looking wanderer who is traveling near an Arabian-like place, where he is lured to a prize machine. He sees a golden lamp but can't get it because another man wants it and is already using the machine. The man however lucks out and gets candy beans. He runs to the back corner in order to weep his sorrow away.
Egghead sneaks up and tries his luck at getting the gold-lamp, and succeeds. He says, "Oh boy am I lucky". It is then revealed that the only he reason he got the lamp was because he mistakes it for a sugar bowl. He looks at the back of the lamp and it reads, "Rub Lamp 3 times". Egghead does so and a genie appears, which scares Egghead and he runs off; only for the genie to pull him right back.
The genie then explains to him that he isn't, going to hurt him. He also explains to Egghead that he is now the master of the lamp, and that if he ever needed anything all he needed to do was rub the lamp. Egghead asks for some, "Nice new clothes", and the genie responds by changing what he is wearing. This makes Egghead smile, and he thanks the genie. Hiding behind the corner is the same guy who previously ruined his chance to get the lamp. He claims that the lamp belongs to him and that he will get it.
Meanwhile, Egghead sees a sign advertising that a man will be giving away his daughter hand in marriage by setting up a contest. Egghead then wishes for a magic carpet and one appears. He takes off to the "Royal Palace" and hopes to win the princess's hand in marriage, but finds that there is long line before him.
The princess cries as two guards send in a tough-looking but dumb man named Ali-Baabe Breen, who repeats "Mary had a little lamb". This doesn't impress the sultan and he opens a hatch and sends Ali falling into it.
As several contenders enter including "Slap Happy Boys", Egghead emerges with the title, "Aladdin and his wonderful lamp". His lamp has been stolen and has been replaced. The minute the princess sees him, she falls madly in love. Egghead tries to please the king by performing the song "Bei Mir Bistu Shein", but it only annoys him. Egghead tries to please the sultan with his magic lamp, but his stupidity gets the better of him, and he doesn't realize that he doesn't have it any more. He claims that the lamp is crazy and is thrown out of the palace.  
He watches from the window. Inside the man who stole his lamp is trying to impress the king and thanks to his lamp is doing an incredible job. The Sultan declares a wedding and the horn is played, but Egghead arrives shouting, "I've been swindled" and knocks the man right out. He grabs the princess and takes off with her. At the end she decides to go with the Genie because he looks more attractive.


== Reception ==
On September 1, 1938, Motion Picture Exhibitor said, "Another Schlesinger laff-hit. The boy, who talks like Joe Penner, secures the magic lamp, has it stolen from him as he competes for the Caliph's daughter, wins her anyway, recovers the lamp for her real desires — a composite Robert Taylor, Clark Gable. It's all very funny."


== Notes ==
This was the first of two Egghead cartoons co-supervised by Cal Dalton (with Cal Howard). The second was "Count Me Out" (Directed by Cal Dalton with Ben Hardaway).
This short rarely airs on American television due to Arabic and African stereotypes, particularly of Egghead's genie

=== A-Lad-In His Lamp ===
A-Lad-In His Lamp is a 1948 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon. The short stars Bugs Bunny, and features the Genie and Caliph Hassan Pfeffer, who is after Bugs and the genie in his lamp. The voices of Bugs Bunny and Caliph Hassan Pfeffer are voiced by Mel Blanc, and the voice of the genie is played by Jim Backus. The cartoon is a takeoff of the story of Aladdin's Lamp. Elements of this short would later be re-used for the Arabian era in Bugs Bunny & Taz: Time Busters.


== Plot ==
Bugs finds Aladdin's lamp while digging a rabbit hole; believing that it is junk, he starts to clean it, rubbing off the dirt so that he can use it as an ashtray. A genie appears and tells him to make a wish. Calling him "Smokey," Bugs reluctantly starts to make multiple wishes, only to be interrupted by the genie each time. Bugs ultimately requests two carrots, which the genie produces.
"Smokey" remarks that he wants to return to his home in Baghdad, and Bugs, imagining how fabulous it must be, remarks to himself that he wishes that he could go to Baghdad. Interpreting it as an actual wish, the genie then puts Bugs in the lamp and fires him from it like a cannon, and the two fly off to Baghdad. As they arrive, Bugs sputters and 'conks out,' and he and the lamp fall into the Royal Palace of Caliph Hassan Pfeffer, angering the caliph, who then wants the lamp. When Bugs refuses, the caliph threatens Bugs at swordpoint, and a chase ensues, during which Bugs' attempts to enlist the lazy genie's help fail.
Bugs eventually tries to escape from the caliph by taking a magic carpet rigged with an outboard motor. When Bugs tries to draw the genie again he drives the genie's date (a female genie) away; the genie becomes extremely angry and warns Bugs saying, "If you disturb me once more, I'll beat you to a pulp." The carpet's motor runs out of gas, and Bugs crash-lands back into the palace, and the caliph now has possession of the lamp. When the caliph tries to draw the genie out of the lamp, in spite of Bugs' warning not to try this, the genie emerges, larger and angrier than before, and beats the caliph to a pulp, making good on his threat if he was bothered again.
Cheering Bugs on his victory, he grants Bugs a wish as a celebration. He whispers to "Smokey," who produces a ball that becomes a puff of smoke when dropped. The scene concludes showing Bugs as a caliph himself, surrounded by a harem of female rabbits, and wondering "what the poor rabbits are doing this season."


== Home media ==
A-Lad-In His Lamp has been released on the Warner Home Video laserdisc Wince Upon A Time, and the VHS releases Bugs Bunny's Hare Raising Tales and Looney Tunes Collector's Edition: Daffy Doodles.


== Depiction of Middle Easterners ==
This short was the earliest in the Bugs Bunny series to be set in either the Middle East or North Africa, and the first to feature Arabs or Islam. In this case, the setting is Baghdad, depicted with Las Vegas-style flashy signs and desert-like streets. Also depicted is the used rug lot of Mad Man Hassan, where people can sell their magic carpets. The scene soon shifts to the palace of Caliph Hassan Pfeffer, built on a G.I. loan, a mortgage loan for veterans guaranteed by the federal government of the United States.
The caliph is depicted as a lazy man, reclining on pillows and smoking a hookah. When he discovers the magic lamp of Aladdin, his expression turns to "child-like glee" and his motive for the rest of the short is greed. His facial expressions during the pursuit of the lamp tend toward the grotesque, while he is waving a big sword and growling. As do Middle Eastern villains in other Looney Tunes shorts, he has bushy eyebrows, moustache and beard which enhance his physically intimidating presence.
Such shorts reinforce stereotypes concerning Muslims and Middle Easterners, depicting them as lazy, hedonistic, pleasure-seeking, easily angered, and indiscriminately and irrationally violent. Punishments for various offenses are depicted as too severe, Draconian in favoring capital punishment for the most minor of offenses. "Death is the default punishment" is a concept used to reinforce such stereotypes. The G.I. loan that financed the building of the caliph's palace fits another stereotype: that of Muslim men deriving their power from the support of the Western world. These shorts tend to make no distinctions among Arabs, Muslims, and Persians, terms which in popular culture tend to be depicted as "interchangeable".
For all the menace of their weapons (often swords), they are inept in using them and easily manipulated by the "Western hero" Bugs. Also lacking are depictions of diligence and productivity in the Middle East, thus portraying the Middle East as being a cultural backwater, unaffected by modernity.

In 1991 when the short was one of 120 Looney Tunes being shown in AMC Theatres nationwide prior to, and during, the Gulf War; Warner Bros. responded to criticism from Casey Kasem, voice artist and radio personality of Arab descent, by issuing the following statement:"To see the short is to recognize it as simply a classic cartoon, produced 43 years ago, satirizing a classic children’s fairy tale, intended - as all our cartoons are - only as good-natured fun".Vivian Boyer of Warner Bros. further clarified that "it was never intended to be a racist cartoon".

=== A-League Men ===
A-League Men, also known as the Isuzu UTE A-League for sponsorship reasons, is a professional soccer league in Australia and New Zealand and the highest level of the Australian soccer league system. Established in 2004 as the A-League by the Australian Soccer Association (ASA) as a successor to the National Soccer League (NSL), competition commenced in August 2005.
Administered by Australian Professional Leagues (APL), it is contested by thirteen teams; eleven based in Australia with two in New Zealand. Seasons run from October to May and include a 27-round regular season followed by a finals series playoff involving the six highest-placed teams, culminating in a grand final match. Winners of the regular season is dubbed the 'Premier' while the winner of the grand final is the season's Champion; differing from other football codes in Australia, where premier refers to the grand final winner and the winner of the regular season is the 'minor premier'.
Most successful clubs for the season are granted qualification into the Asian continental club competitions, the AFC Champions League Elite and the AFC Champions League Two. In 2014, the Western Sydney Wanderers became the first and only winning Australian club of the AFC Champions League. Like the United States' MLS, as well as other professional sports leagues in Australia, it does not practice relegation and promotion and furthermore institutes a salary cap. The men's, women's and youth are also brought together under the unified A-Leagues banner.


== History ==


=== Background ===
A national round-robin tournament existed in various forms prior to the formation of the A-League, with the most notable being the National Soccer League (NSL). The formation of the NSL came after Australia's qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, which led to discussion of a national league, with 14 teams eventually chosen to participate in the inaugural season of the NSL in 1977.
Under the guidance of the then-governing body, the Australian Soccer Federation (later Soccer Australia), the NSL flourished through the 1980s and early 1990s but then fell into decline with the increasing departure of Australian players to overseas leagues, a disastrous television deal with the Seven Network and the resulting lack of sponsorship. Few clubs continued to grow with Sydney Olympic, Perth Glory, and the newly established Adelaide United the exception in a dying league.
In April 2003, the Australian Federal Government initiated the Independent Soccer Review Committee to investigate the governance and management of the sport in Australia, including that of the NSL. In December 2003, a Crawford Report found that the NSL was financially unviable, and in response the chairman of the sport's new governing body, Frank Lowy of the Football Federation Australia, announced a task force would be formed to create a new national competition a successor to the NSL which had  dissolved at the conclusion of the 2003–04 season after 27 years of operation.


=== Foundations ===
The A-League was announced in April 2004, succeeding the NSL. Eight teams would be part of the new national competition, with one team from each city of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Newcastle, plus a New Zealand team and one from a remaining expressions of interest from either Melbourne or Sydney. The competition start date was set for August 2005.
By June, 20 submissions had been received and a month later 12 consortiums sent in their final bids for the eight spots. Three bids were received from Melbourne, two each from Sydney and Brisbane, one from each of the remaining preferred cities and a bid from the New South Wales Central Coast city of Gosford. Over the next three months, each bid was reviewed and on 1 November 2004, the eight successful bidders and the major sponsor were revealed, for what would be known as the 'Hyundai A-League', with the Hyundai Motor Company unveiled as the official naming rights sponsor for the league.
The eight founding teams were Adelaide United, the Central Coast Mariners, the Melbourne Victory, the Newcastle Jets, the New Zealand Knights, Perth Glory, the Queensland Roar, and Sydney FC. Along with four former NSL clubs taking part; Adelaide United, the Newcastle Jets, and Perth Glory, as well as the Queensland Lions who withdrew their first team from the Queensland State League and entered as the Queensland Roar plus the New Zealand Knights who were formed from the New Zealand Football Kingz. Club were given a five-year exclusivity deal in their own market as part of a  "one-city, one-team" policy strategy; intended to allow clubs to grow and develop an identity in their respective region without local competition.


=== Initial seasons ===
On 26 August 2005, 16 months after the demise of the NSL, the inaugural season of the A-League began. The first season would see Adelaide United win the premier's plate by seven points over Sydney FC with Central Coast and Newcastle filling the final two spots in the final series. In the final series, Sydney that took out the title after they defeated Central Coast by a Steve Corica goal to claim the first title on 5 March 2006. The following season saw Melbourne Victory claim the A-League premiers plate when they smashed Adelaide United 6–0 in the final at the Telstra Dome with Archie Thompson scoring five goals in the rout. But the season wasn't without a change with the New Zealand Knights being replaced by the Wellington Phoenix after the Knights were taken over by New Zealand Football after the team only won six times in forty-two games and selected overseas talent instead of local.


=== Development and reforms ===

Both Gold Coast United and the North Queensland Fury joined the league in the 2009–10 season. On 12 June 2009, Melbourne Heart was awarded a licence to join the 2010–11 season. On 1 March 2011 North Queensland Fury's A-League licence was revoked for financial reasons. On 29 February 2012, Gold Coast United also had its licence revoked. On 4 April 2012, it was announced that a new Western Sydney-based club, Western Sydney Wanderers, would join the league for the 2012–13 season. In January 2014, Melbourne Heart was acquired by the City Football Group and was renamed Melbourne City ahead of the 2014–15 season. In February 2018, officials announced that the league would expand to 12 teams for the 2019–20 season. Later that year, the league announced that Western United FC would join the competition in 2019–20 and Macarthur would enter the following season (2020–21).
In the lead-up to the expansion announcements in 2019, club stakeholders entered into discussions with Football Federation Australia (FFA) to take over ownership of the competition. The league had been created and operated by the FFA since its inception in 2004, though by 2018 the FFA and clubs were at loggerheads over the permanent ownership structure of the league. A FIFA-backed congress review working group issued a sweeping 100-page report in August 2018, recommending an expanded domestic congress and an independent A-League, controlled and operated by the clubs.
On 1 July 2019, the FFA and Australian Professional Football Clubs Association (the body representing the A-League clubs) announced an agreement had been reached for the FFA to relinquish control of the league to the clubs by the following month, in time for the start of the 2019–20 season. The agreement brought the sport in line with the governance structure utilised in most European leagues. The new ownership body is called the Australian Professional Leagues, a consortium of the A-League clubs and their owners, with certain rights held by the FFA, and a capital investment & ownership stake held by American firm Silver Lake. A-League officials in May 2021 announced that the league will align to the Domestic Match Calendar to avoid clashing with FIFA Days, as well as introducing Domestic Transfer System and National Club Licensing frameworks.


== Competition format ==


=== Regular season ===
The regular season runs mainly during the Australian summer, from early October to April of the following year. As of the 2024–25 season, due to the introduction of Auckland FC and an odd number of teams, the competition consists of 29 rounds, with each team playing every other team two or three times, playing 26 games total. Each team will play 24 home and away fixtures, plus two additional third matches (one of which in Unite Round). Additionally, each team will have three byes. The teams allotted two home matches against an opponent in one season are allotted one home match against that opponent in the following season. Each match sees the winning team awarded three competition points, with one point each for a draw. The club at the top of this ladder is crowned A-League Premiers, and since the 2005–06 season has been entered into the AFC Champions League. The Premier is presented with a trophy known as the Premier's Plate.
At the completion of the regular season the top six placed teams on the league table progress to the finals series. The position of each team is determined by the highest number of points accumulated during the regular season. If two or more teams are level on points, the following criteria are applied in order until one of the teams can be determined as the higher ranked:

Highest goal difference;
Highest number of goals scored;
Most wins;
Highest number of points accumulated in matches between the teams concerned;
Highest goal difference in matches between the teams concerned;
Highest number of goals scored in matches between the teams concerned;
Lowest number of red cards accumulated;
Lowest number of yellow cards accumulated;
Toss of a coin.


==== Unite Round ====

For the 2023–24 and 2024–25 season, the Australian Professional Leagues announced "Unite Round". During this round, all matches were held in Sydney, in Allianz Stadium and CommBank Stadium, with some women's matches being held at Leichhardt Oval, across the second weekend of January. The round is part of a partnership with Destination NSW, and was introduced after the Grand Final decision was reversed in October 2023, one year into its original 3-year stretch after severe fan backlash.


==== Pride Round ====
After Adelaide United player Josh Cavallo became the first openly gay top-flight male footballer in October 2021, the A-League partnered with A-League Women to stage a single Pride men's and women's doubleheader during the 2021–22 season.
On 24–26 February 2023, both the A-League Men and Women's competitions staged their first-ever Pride Round, the first occasion in which the leagues had "come together to recognise and promote inclusion for the LGBTQIA+ community". Part proceeds from ticket sales across all of the round's fixtures were donated to Pride Cup. In 2024, the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) announced the continuation of the round, as well as providing inclusion training to all players and key stakeholders. The A-Leagues would be collaborating with the PFA and Pride Cup, who would help to deliver the training. The annual Pride Cup double-header between Adelaide United and Melbourne Victory would take place in March, and several men's and women's teams would celebrate by engaging community groups and using indicators such as rainbow corner flags, armbands, special Pride kit and/or rainbow socks.


=== Finals series ===

The top six clubs at the conclusion of the regular season progress to the finals series. The finals series culminates to the A-League grand final, where the winner is crowned A-League champion. The club that wins the grand final is presented with the A-League Champions Trophy.
The finals series consists of six teams who are placed by rank, as determined at the end of the regular season. The finals series runs over four weeks. In the first week of fixtures, the third-through-sixth ranked teams play a single-elimination match, with the two winners of those matches joining the first and second ranked teams in two-legged ties played over two weeks. The two winners of those matches meet in the grand final. This method was initially adopted for the 2021–22 season.
Up until 2022, between the two grand finalists, the team that finished higher on the ladder at the conclusion of the regular season hosted the grand final. The only exception to this was if the FA deemed that team's home ground to be an inappropriate venue. For example, in 2008, Central Coast Mariners (as the higher-placed team) hosted the grand final against the Newcastle Jets at Sydney Football Stadium, due to FFA deciding that Central Coast Mariners' home stadium, Central Coast Stadium with a capacity of 20,000, was too small for the event.
On 12 December 2022, the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) announced that the grand finals for the 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25 seasons would be hosted in Sydney, a decision which received considerable backlash. On 18 October 2023, the APL announced that the Grand Final hosting rights would revert to the original format, and instead a new "Unite Round" was introduced, with a regular season round having all its games played in Sydney.

=== Continental qualification ===


==== AFC Champions League Elite ====

Australian A-League clubs are eligible for participation in the AFC Champions League competition each season since the 2007 edition of the tournament. Wellington Phoenix and Auckland FC are not eligible to compete in the Asian Champions League, nor do they compete in the OFC Champions League. Qualification is determined by league finishing positions and the winner of the Australia Cup Final, with the number of positions determined by the Asian Football Confederation club competition ranking. Due to the re-formatting of the AFC Champions League to have an inter-year schedule from September (northern hemisphere autumn-to-spring) instead of an intra-year schedule (northern hemisphere spring-to-autumn), the qualification format for the 2023–24 AFC Champions League was changed, with a single qualification spot going to whichever of which of the Premiers for the 2021–22 or the 2022–23 seasons accrues the most combined points over both seasons.
The only Australian side to win the Asian Champions League is Western Sydney Wanderers in 2014. Adelaide United is the only other club to reach the final, and finished runner-up in 2008.


==== AFC Champions League Two ====
Australian clubs also participated in the AFC Cup for the first time in the 2023–24 season, with allocated slots based on the AFC Club Competitions Ranking which was published on 24 November 2021.  Central Coast Mariners won this edition in their first ever participation.


=== Other competitions ===
In 2004–05, Australia was still a part of the Oceania Football Confederation and Sydney FC won the right to compete in the Oceania Club Championship after defeating the Central Coast Mariners in a qualifying tournament.
Since 2014 clubs compete in the annual Australia Cup knock-out tournament (previously known as the FFA Cup). Since 2021, the top eight teams qualify for the competition's Round of 32, while the bottom four teams play-off against each other for the final two slots.
Between 2005 and 2008 clubs participated in the A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup prior to each A-League regular season. In 2013 and 2014 an A-League All Stars Game was also played as a pre-season friendly game between the league's finest players and a high-profile international team.
Most A-League Men clubs have teams in the A-League Youth competition, which runs in conjunction with the A-League Men as a national youth developmental and reserve league. All players in the youth teams are between the ages of 16 and 21 as of the start of the calendar year for each new season, while four over-age players from each of the senior teams also allowed to be selected. In addition, the A-League Women operates as the top division of women's league with affiliations to the men's competition. However, the A-League Youth has not been resumed since the COVID-19 pandemic.
In response to the debate about the development of a new professional second division, the Australian Championship has been proposed to support the A-League, with the aim to avoid the American franchise-based system and to put in line with European football leagues.


== Clubs ==

The league is currently contested by 13 teams: eleven from Australia and two from New Zealand. A total of 16 teams have competed at some stage in the league's short history. Only four of these clubs – Adelaide United, the Brisbane Roar (as the Queensland Lions), the Newcastle Jets, and the Perth Glory – existed before the A-League was formed in 2004. Gold Coast United, the New Zealand Knights, and the North Queensland Fury have formerly competed in the league.
Unlike most leagues from across the world, there is no system for relegation and promotion of teams. The A-Leagues system thus shares some franchising elements with most other professional leagues in Australia, Major League Soccer, Canadian Premier League, and other major Northern American-based sports leagues.

=== Expansion ===

While making a relatively modest start to ensure future stability, both the FFA and the soccer media indicated significant interest in expanding the league. The eight foundation clubs had exclusivity clauses for their respective cities valid for five years, but this did not exclude teams from other areas joining the league.
Before the introduction of the A-League, FFA chairman Frank Lowy speculated that he hoped to expand the league into other cities, mentioning Canberra, Hobart, Wollongong, Geelong, Bendigo, Cairns, Ballarat, Albury–Wodonga, Launceston, Christchurch, Auckland, Sunshine Coast and possibly Darwin and later Singapore.
In February 2018, officials announced that the league would expand to 12 teams for the 2019–20 season. In December 2018, the FFA announced they accepted the bids of Western United who joined the league in the 2019–20 season and of Macarthur FC, who joined the league in the 2020–21 season.
In 2021, further steps were taken in an attempt to expand from the recent 12 clubs, with goals being set to get 14 clubs in 2022–23 and a potential 16 clubs in 2023–24. Neither of these goals were met.
In March 2023, the Australian Professional Leagues confirmed plans for the next two expansion clubs to be based in Canberra and Auckland, ahead of the 2024–25 season.
In October 2023, the preferred bidder as owner of the new Auckland licence was confirmed to be Bill Foley. The licence was officially awarded to Foley on 21 November 2023. Auckland FC will join the league in the 2024–25 season.
On 13 June 2024, the APL confirmed that the new Canberra men's team would not begin in the 2024–25 season.
On 13 February 2025, it was reported that Canberra's entrance would be delayed another season.


=== Rivalries ===
There are several key rivalries and local derbies that have formed in the A-League, including:
"Melbourne Derby" – Melbourne City v Melbourne Victory
The two Melbourne clubs first met on 8 October 2010 in a lively game at AAMI Park in front of 25,897 fans. Melbourne City (known at the time as Melbourne Heart) came out on top with a 2–1 victory. A significant narrative in derby history is the role of Melbourne Victory as a more successful club both on and off the field, having joined the A-League five years earlier than City. The rivalry is one of the most intense and well respected in the A-League, producing noticeable atmosphere and some of the largest attendances in the league.
"The Original Rivalry" – Adelaide United v Melbourne Victory 
The rivalry stems from the traditional cross-border rivalry between sporting teams from South Australia and Victoria but was strengthened by multiple incidents in the 2006–07 season, such as the confrontation between Melbourne Victory captain Kevin Muscat and Adelaide United coach John Kosmina. The two clubs contested the 2007 and 2009 A-League Grand Finals, with Melbourne winning the 2009 Grand Final 1–0 against a 10-man Adelaide United side. The two clubs were also involved in the first and only occasion in the A-League during the 2008–09 A-League season, where they both finished on the top of the ladder equal on both points and goal difference.
"Sydney Derby" – Sydney FC v Western Sydney Wanderers
The derby was contested for the first time in the 2012–13 season with the introduction of the second Sydney-based club, Western Sydney Wanderers, into the league. Sydney FC grabbed bragging rights by winning the first derby 1–0 at Parramatta Stadium, however Western Sydney Wanderers won the return match at Allianz Stadium 2–0. A Sydney Derby held early in the 2015 season broke the Allianz Stadium record for attendance during a regular season in any football code, dating back to the stadium's opening in 1988. A match in 2016 between the two teams broke the record A-League crowd with 61,880 fans attending the match at ANZ Stadium. Sydney Derby is intensified by the geographic distinction between the two clubs within Sydney, as well as historical grievances related to the foundation of Sydney FC.
"The Big Blue" – Melbourne Victory v Sydney FC
This match is so named because blue is the main colour of both teams' playing kits, and is also Australian slang for a fight or a contest. The rivalry has emerged as a result of a number of spiteful encounters between the teams in recent years, and due to the longstanding rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities. The teams have competed against each other in three grand finals; in 2010 & 2017, with Sydney winning 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw on both occasions and in 2015, with Victory winning 3–0. In 2010, Sydney FC won the A-League Premiership on the final day of the season by defeating Victory 2–0. A Big Blue match is traditionally played on Australia Day each year.
"The F3 Derby" – Central Coast Mariners v Newcastle Jets
Named after the former name of the freeway that connects the cities of Newcastle and Gosford, this match features the only two clubs in the A-League that are not based in state or national capital cities. The two teams' stadiums are just one hour apart, and the derby was intensified when they competed against each other for the premiership in the 2007–08 A-League season and eventually met in the Grand Final, which was won 1–0 by the Jets. Since 2022, the teams have competed for a trophy made out of a core drill sample of the motorway.
"The Distance Derby" – Perth Glory v Wellington Phoenix
First contested in Wellington with their introduction to the A-League in 2007–08, this fixture is considered one of the longest away trips in world football for a domestic top-flight competition, with the distance between the two cities (which themselves are in different countries) being 5,225 km. Since 2015–16, the two teams have contested the "Long Distance Derby Cup", which is awarded to the team with the best results from the three regular season fixtures between them.
"New Zealand Derby" / "Mai te Raki ki te Tonga" – Auckland FC v Wellington Phoenix
With the introduction of expansion club Auckland FC for the 2024–25 season, Wellington will have an opponent from the same country for the first time. The first ever edition of this derby is scheduled for 2 November 2024 at Wellington Regional Stadium, and they will meet a further two times during the season. On 9 August 2024, Auckland announced the signing of former Wellington goalkeeper Alex Paulsen, on loan from AFC Bournemouth which was thought to be in contravention of the "Caceres rule" which the APL had only announced that morning would be reviewed. Following this announcement, Wellington raised concerns with Football Australia "seeking further information" about the loan move. Shortly before the start of the 2024–25 season, the League announced the official name of the derby would be "Kiwi Clasico", however, official channels stopped using that name once the season began. On the day of the first ever match between the two clubs, Te Āti Awa and Ngāti Whātua presented a special taonga to be awarded to the winner, and dubbed the derby "Mai te Raki ki te Tonga", which translates to 'From the North to the South' from the Māori language.

=== Logo and trophies ===

The current A-League logo was unveiled in September 2021, as part of a re-branding of both the A-League and W-League, bringing them under the same umbrella of "A-Leagues" by the Australian Professional Leagues. The logo was designed by R/GA, a creative agency in Sydney, and led to a major controversy but narrowly avoided legal trouble with building company in Adelaide over design similarities. Isuzu UTE became the naming rights sponsor of the A-League Men in October 2021, and therefore features on all branding. This partnership was extended a further two years in December 2023.
In January 2017, Football Federation Australia unveiled their new A-League logo which formed part of a wider rebranding branding of the A-League and its subsidiary competitions, the W-League and Youth League. The logo design was "inspired by soccer's three outstanding features – atmosphere, diversity and unity" and has colour alterations tailored to each of the 12 A-League clubs. The changes came into effect before the 2017/18 season. The original A-League logo was designed by Coast Design Sydney. It was the inaugural logo of the league. The two-toned ochre colours represented the sun, earth and desert while the 'glow' emanating from the centre of the logo depicted the playing season's spring and summer time span. The eight 'A' figures that made up the ball shape represented the eight foundation clubs of the league.
The A-League has two trophies which are competed for during the season: the Premier's Plate and the A-League Trophy. The Premier's Plate is awarded to the A-League Premiers, the regular season winners, and the A-League Trophy is awarded to the A-League Champions, the winner of the Grand Final. Both pieces of silverware were designed by Sydney design company D3 Design. The A-League Trophy is nicknamed the "Toilet Seat" due to its shape. Where as the Premier's Plate follows a traditional trophy design, the A-League Trophy differs. In 2005, John O'Neill, FFA CEO commented during the unveiling of the A-League Trophy, "We have a new national league and we feel it is important to re-define the conventional view of a trophy to reflect this". Clive Solari of D3 Design explained the trophy's design, saying "We wanted our trophy concept to embody the historical significance of sport in a contemporary design. So we looked to history to see how great achievements have been rewarded across all types of games for thousands of years. The winners of the world's original sporting competition, the Olympic Games, were presented with a laurel wreath on their heads. We used this model as a basis for a unique, cutting-edge design – our trophy is a modern and versatile translation of the wreath. The winners can hold it above their heads as a symbol of success".


=== Squad formation and salary cap ===

The A-League match-day squad includes the typical 11 players, and five substitutes of which one must be a goalkeeper. Prior to the 2013–14 season, just four substitutes including one goalkeeper were allowed to be named in the starting line-ups for the teams.
An squad must comprise a minimum of 20 players with a maximum of 26, subject to several limitations. Within the squad, there can be a maximum of five "foreign" or "Visa" players, from outside Australia (and New Zealand, in the case of clubs based there), that hold a temporary working-visa. Three players in the squad must also be under 20 years of age. In addition to these three under 20 players, clubs are allowed to sign an additional three youth players onto full-time contracts at a lower pay rate than the rest of the squad. The A-League had initially proposed that the quota of five visa players per A-League club be reduced to four in the 2015–16 season, with the limit of four possibly become "3+1", which means three imports from anywhere and one from Asia (following regulations in the AFC Champions League). However, after opposition to the proposal by both players and managers, the move was placed on hold.
Although A-League clubs have restricted salaries (salary cap), the league since its inception allowed clubs to have two "marquee" players whose salaries are exempt from the cap, plus a number of other 'exemptions' or 'allowances' to incentivise clubs to spend in specific areas. Guest players are also excluded for up to a maximum of 14 league matches. From the 2008–09 season, A-League clubs have been permitted a junior marquee player; one that is under the age of 23. Now known as the 'Homegrown Player allowance', clubs can spend up to a collective $150,000 on three Australian players aged 23 or younger that have come through the club's youth system. 
On 19 April 2010, the A-League announced that, in addition to the international marquee and junior marquee, clubs would be allowed an Australian marquee from the 2010–11 season. Notable marquee and guest players have included Alessandro Del Piero, William Gallas, Dwight Yorke, Keisuke Honda, Damien Duff, Emile Heskey, Robbie Fowler, Shinji Ono, David Villa and former FIFA World Player of the Year Romário. Famous Australian Marquees include Harry Kewell, John Aloisi, Brett Emerton, Joshua Kennedy and Tim Cahill. From the 2021–22 A-League Men season, the league added a designated player slot, whose salary is exempt from the cap, but must be $300,000–$600,000 per season. The following season, the league added a second designated player slot for each club.
Commencing in the 2015–16 season, players who have played at their club for 5–10 years will be covered by a "loyalty player allowance", allowing up to $200,000 of their salary to be exempted from the cap. Additionally, clubs are now permitted a mature-age rookie whose wages are outside the salary cap. The 2016–17 season saw the introduction of a third 'Full Season Guest Marquee' spot, designed to attract high-profile players on short-term deals. 
The salary cap for A-League clubs is $2.1 million for the 2020–21 season, in the case for new clubs debuting, they were entitled to a $333,000 allowance thus increasing their salary cap to $2.433 million. Clubs must spend at least the salary floor which is $1.7 million. The salary cap applies to the 18 to 23 players that clubs have registered to their A-League player roster, the top 2 highest-paid players (Designated Players) don't count in the cap. 
Players registered at a club for more than 4 consecutive years as a professional are considered as 'Loyalty Players' and have the following amounts exempt from a club's salary cap; Year 4 – 12.5%, Year 5 – 25%, and 5% increments after that up until a max of 50%. Teams can spend an unlimited amount on 4 U-23 Australian players who have come from the youth team, called 'Homegrown Players'. Teams can sign up to 9 U-20 players on minimum wage called 'Scholarship Players' who don't count in the squad unless they are one of the 3 U21's in the squad, any payments above the national minimum wage to these Players are included in the club's Salary Cap.


=== Stadiums ===

A-League games have been played in 33 stadiums since the inaugural season of the A-League in 2005.


=== Sponsorship ===
Since its formation, the A-League has been sponsored by an official naming rights partner. In 2004, the Hyundai Motor Company was announced as the sponsor for the first three seasons of the league, known for commercial purposes as the "Hyundai A-League". In 2008, Hyundai renewed its initial contract with FFA for another four seasons until 2012, and that contract was further extended by four seasons until 2016. This sponsorship deal was then further extended to the end of the 2019–20 A-League season.
On 6 October 2021, Isuzu UTE was announced as the naming rights partner of the A-League Men in a 3-year deal, with the league known as the Isuzu UTE A-League.


== League championships ==

As of the 2023–24 season, 15 different clubs have competed in the league, with eight having won the trophy, and eight winning at least one premier's plate. 6 clubs have won a Premiership-Championship double, a feat achieved 11 times in total.
The winner of the regular season tournament is dubbed the 'Premier' while the winner of the grand final is the season's 'Champion'. This differs from other football codes in Australia, where 'premier' refers to the winner of the grand final and the winner of the regular season is the 'minor premier'.


== Records ==

Brisbane Roar hold the record for the longest unbeaten run in the competition with 36 league matches without defeat.
Jamie Maclaren holds the record for the greatest number of A-League goals, with 151 goals, playing for Perth Glory, Brisbane Roar, and Melbourne City. The A-League record for most goals in a single match is held by Archie Thompson, scoring 5 goals against Adelaide United on 18 February 2007, during the 2007 A-League Grand Final; and Jamie Maclaren who scored 5 goals against Melbourne Victory on 17 April 2021.
Jamie Maclaren has scored the most A-League hat-tricks with 8.
Shane Smeltz and Bobô are the only players to have scored hat-tricks in consecutive matches.
Henrique was the first, and so far only, player to score a hat-trick coming on as a substitute, for Brisbane Roar against Newcastle Jets.
In 2015, Austrian striker Marc Janko broke the record for scoring in consecutive matches when he scored in seven games for Sydney FC.


== Media coverage ==


=== In Australia ===

From the start of the 2005–06 season to the 2012–13 season, television coverage of the A-League in Australia was restricted to the subscription-only Fox Sports channel, to which only 7% of Australian residents had access.
On 19 November 2012, free-to-air Australian public broadcasting television network Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) secured the shared rights, alongside long-time A-League broadcasters Fox Sports, to the A-League from the 2013–14 season with a A$160 million four-year broadcast deal.
SBS's coverage ended in the 2016–17 season, with Network Ten securing free-to-air broadcast rights. Ten simulcasted the Fox Sports coverage of the Saturday night fixture on its digital multichannel One.
From the 2019–20 season, ABC TV has broadcast one game a weekend (Saturday 5pm) live on its primary channel. It also has the right to broadcast delayed coverage of some finals matches and the Grand Final. Fox Sport's contract with the A-League, which was renegotiated in June 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, concluded in July 2021.
Since August 2021, as part of a five-year deal with ViacomCBS, the A-Leagues are being broadcast by Network 10 and Paramount+ streaming service. Initially one A-League Men match per weekend was broadcast on Ten's main channel and all matches were streamed on Paramount. Paramount+ and 10 hold broadcasting rights through to 2028.


=== Other countries ===
In New Zealand the league has been broadcast on Sky Sport since its inaugural season. In the 2019–20 season, the league also broadcast on Qatari beIN Sports after Sky ink four-year partnership for extensive soccer coverage, especially the A-league.
The growth of coverage of the A-League outside Australia saw the league broadcast in 65 countries around the world in 2013/14. Full match broadcasts are available in the United States, China, Italy, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Canada, the Caribbean, Hong Kong, Singapore and Myanmar. In addition to the full match broadcasts, highlights of A-League matches can be viewed in 53 countries throughout Asia and the Middle East, including Japan and South Korea. In 2014, a three-season deal with Sony TEN allowed the league to be broadcast live in Asian nations including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Every A-League match is also live streamed globally, allowing games to be viewed online through a subscription service provided in a partnership with the FFA. All games were also broadcast live in the United States on ESPN+ until 2021. Most games in the United Kingdom are broadcast by BT Sport but use Paramount+ live feed for every live game. For the 2014–15 Season, the A-League was broadcast in 173 countries.


=== Promotion ===
The A-League has been promoted using a number of different advertising slogans and strategies since its inception. At the start of the inaugural season, a A$3 million dollar advertising campaign was launched, with the television and film advertisements produced by Ridley Scott's production company Scott Free Productions. The theme for the campaign was: "Football, but not as you know it". A new television advertisement was created for the start of the 2007–08 season, which debuted on Foxtel's program Total Football. It was filmed at Bob Jane Stadium in Melbourne. Other campaigns include the "90 minutes, 90 emotions", which was used for two seasons from 2007 to 2009 and was accompanied by the music track "My People" from Australian act The Presets.

=== A-League Men Golden Boot ===
The A-League Men Golden Boot is an annual association football award presented to the leading goalscorer in the A-League Men. It was previously referred to as the Nike Golden Boot for sponsorship purposes.
The A-League was founded in 2005 to replace the semi-professional National Soccer League. The number of teams in the league has ranged from eight to twelve and there are currently twelve clubs in the league. The award is given to the top-scorer over the regular season (not including the finals series). The inaugural award was shared by four players: Alex Brosque, Bobby Despotovski, Stewart Petrie and Archie Thompson.
Jamie Maclaren has won the golden boot on five occasions, more than any other player. Petrie was the first non-Australian winner in the league's inaugural season.
Bobô – with 27 goals in 2017–18 – scored the most goals to win the Golden Boot, while Danny Allsopp scored the fewest to win the award outright, with 11 goals in 2006–07. The all-time record for lowest number of goals scored to be bestowed the award, however, is 8 goals; this was achieved during the 2005–06 season, when the award was shared between four players. This marks one of two seasons in which the award has been shared, the other being the 2016–17 season, where the award was shared between Jamie Maclaren and Besart Berisha. Bobô recorded the highest goals-to-games ratio to win the award, scoring 27 goals in 27 games in 2017–18 for a rate of 1.00.
In 2024, Adam Taggart became the first ever player in the Australian top flight to win the Golden Boot from a team that finished bottom, scoring 20 goals in 25 games for Perth Glory.
In 2025, Archie Goodwin became the youngest ever A-League golden boot winner, at 20 years and 178 days, eclipsing Adam Taggart from the 2013/14 season.

=== A-League Men Grand Final ===
The A-League Men Grand Final is an association football match to determine the champions for an A-League Men season. Played at the end of the finals series, the game has been held annually since 2006.
The club which wins the grand final receives the A-League Men championship trophy which looks like a toilet seat, and the best player receives the Joe Marston Medal.
As of 2024, a total of 19 grand finals have been played, four of which have ended in penalty shoot-outs. Sydney FC have won five grand finals, the most of any club; Melbourne Victory have the second-most with four, and Central Coast Mariners and Brisbane Roar third-most with three. Sydney FC have also appeared in the most grand finals, a total of seven; and the only club along with Brisbane Roar and the Central Coast Mariners to win back-to-back Grand Finals. Every current A-League Men club has played in at least one grand final, with the exception of Macarthur FC and Wellington Phoenix.


== Match history ==


=== Early years (2005–2010) ===

The A-League Men was established for the 2005–06 season by eight clubs, after the National Soccer League folded in 2004. The national league finals system was then reverted to the page playoff system, so only top four teams can qualify. The first grand final in 2006 took place at Sydney Football Stadium between Sydney FC and Central Coast Mariners as Sydney FC won the home ground advantage by defeating premiers Adelaide United to host. Sydney won 1–0 to become the first champions of the A-League Men. The first Joe Marston Medalist was Dwight Yorke, captain of Sydney FC at the time. In 2007, The Original Rivalry teams of premiers Melbourne Victory defeated Adelaide United 6–0; the largest margin of an A-League Men grand final. At Telstra Dome (now Marvel Stadium), it set the largest sporting attendance at the venue of 55,436. Archie Thompson scored five in the match; the only player to score five goals in an A-League Men grand final, earning him the Joe Marston Medal.
The grand final in 2008 between the Central Coast Mariners and Newcastle Jets, despite Central Coast as the host winner and Bluetongue Stadium (now Industree Group Stadiums) being deemed by FFA insufficient capacity to host the grand final, Sydney Football Stadium instead hosted the grand final for the second time, which was won 1–0 by Newcastle. The Original Rivalry teams returned to the grand final in 2009, with Victory claiming their second championship; winning 1–0 against Adelaide becoming the first A-Leagues club to win the domestic treble. Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC, teams of The Big Blue were the grand finalists of 2010; the fourth consecutive rivalry grand final since 2007. Sydney won 4–2 after the first penalty shoot-out in the A-League Men grand final after a 1–1 draw at Etihad Stadium's third and final A-League Men grand final.


=== 2011–2019 ===

With Brisbane Roar claiming the premiership and hosting the grand final in 2011 against Central Coast Mariners, it became the first grand final since its establishment outside of Melbourne and Sydney, to be hosted at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. Brisbane won 4–2 on penalties, after a 2–2 draw by two late Brisbane goals in the final four minutes of extra time. Mathew Ryan with the Central Coast Mariners won the Joe Marston Medal as the first to win it on the losing team of the A-League Men grand final. It returned to Suncorp Stadium the following year in 2012, with Brisbane against the Perth Glory; 2–1 via a late comeback winner, becoming the first A-League Men club to win back-to-back grand finals.
The Western Sydney Wanderers in their first ever season reached the 2013 grand final against the Central Coast Mariners. The host venue was again chosen as Sydney Football Stadium for the third time, due to Wanderers' home ground Parramatta Stadium unable to host due to insufficient capacity for the event. Central Coast won 2–0, after losing their past three grand finals. Western Sydney Wanderers reached the grand final again the following year in 2014 with Brisbane Roar hosting for the third time at Suncorp Stadium for the last three of four grand finals since 2011. Brisbane won 2–1 in extra time to win a record third grand final. The Big Blue teams (Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC) reached the grand final to meet for the second time in 2015. Due to Etihad Stadium and Melbourne Cricket Ground being unavailable for the event, AAMI Park became the last option to play host for the 2015 grand final. Melbourne Victory won 3–0; a record equalling third grand final win to the Brisbane Roar. Adelaide United played host for the first time in their third grand final against the Western Sydney Wanderers also in their third in the past four for the 2016 grand final. Adelaide Oval was the chosen venue, instead of Adelaide's usual home ground Coopers Stadium due to bigger capacity and for hosting high-profile matches. Adelaide United won 3–1 to record their first grand final win and the Western Sydney Wanderers' third loss still yet to win.
The Big Blue teams played the 2017 hosted at Allianz Stadium in Sydney for the fourth time, as Sydney won 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw to equal Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory on most grand final wins with three. Newcastle Jets reached the grand final in 2018 after a ten-year drought against the Melbourne Victory hosted at McDonald Jones Stadium for the first time. Victory won 1–0 for a record fourth grand final win. Kosta Barbarouses' 9th-minute goal in the match become the fastest scored in the A-League Men grand final. It also ultimately sparked controversy for the video assistant referee (VAR) that failed to detect an offside for Victory's awarded goal. Perth Glory qualified for their first grand final since 2012 in Brisbane against Sydney FC at Optus Stadium attended by 56,371; the current record of an A-League Men grand final attendance. Sydney won 4–1 on penalties after 0–0 draw; the third time they won on penalties and the record equalling fourth win overall.


=== 2020–present ===

During the 2019–20 A-League season, it was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and ultimately suspended the season in March 2020. From that point, matches were played behind closed doors, teams travelled interstate, and crowds were restricted for the semi-finals and grand final. These measures caused the entire finals series to be played at Bankwest Stadium (now CommBank Stadium), meaning the 2020 grand final would be first to be hosted at a neutral venue. Whilst originally scheduled for May 2020, it was postponed to August 2020; the first time the A-League Men grand final was played after May. The match was played between Sydney FC and first-timers Melbourne City in a restricted crowd of 7,051. Sydney won 1–0 after extra time to win a record fifth Australian championship and grand final. The same teams met the following year in 2021 with Melbourne City claiming the host at AAMI Park in a 14,017 sell-out crowd of half-capacity, with travelling fans unable to attend due to Sydney's 2021 lockdown. City claimed revenge and won 3–1 to win their first A-League Men grand final. City reached the 2022 grand final for their third consecutive appearance; against locals Western United. It was the first grand final since the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia with no crowd restrictions. Western United won 2–0 to win their first grand final in their third season of existence.

It was announced in December 2022, that the 2023, 2024 and 2025 A-Leagues grand finals would be played in Sydney as part of a deal with Destination NSW, breaking the tradition of the highest placed team to host their grand final; the announcement initially being met with universal backlash from fans of all clubs, former players and active support groups. The 2023 grand final was then initially set to play at CommBank Stadium which would be the second time it would host there, both times as a neutral venue. Melbourne City and Central Coast Mariners were the participants for this grand final, as Central Coast won 6–1; the second A-League Men grand final where a team scored six goals. Fan controversies continued after the match, for the shape of Melbourne City's disadvantages for the match such as outnumbered fans and not hosting at AAMI Park. The Sydney grand final decision was eventually reversed in October 2023, in replacement of Unite Round.

The A-League Men's championship trophy is the main prize for winning the grand final and being crowned champions. Designed by Sydney design company D3 Design, it resembles a laurel wreath. "We used this model as a basis for a unique, cutting-edge design – our trophy is a modern and versatile translation of the wreath. The winners can hold it above their heads as a symbol of success"." It is nicknamed the "Toilet Seat" due to its shape.


=== Joe Marston Medal ===

The Joe Marston Medal is the award given to the player of the match of the A-League Men grand final. It is named after Joe Marston who played for the Australia men's national soccer team from 1947 to 1958 and a member of Preston North End in the 1954 FA Cup final.
It has been awarded ever since the 1980 NSL season which was first won by Abbas Saad with Sydney Olympic. Until the A-League Men was formed, Dwight Yorke with Sydney FC became the first to win the Joe Marston Medal under the A-League Men. Currently, no one has won the award more than once in the A-League Men era.


== Stadiums ==
The stadiums of an A-League Men grand final varies through the highest placed semi-final winning team to host in their own vicinity. Two exceptions have occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and 2023 due to the Sydney grand final decision; both of which have been played at Western Sydney Stadium.
Multiple instances have occurred where clubs' home stadiums are deemed insufficient to host the grand final and instead move to a venue with more capacity in their vicinity. Examples include Central Coast Mariners in 2007 hosting at Sydney Football Stadium instead of Central Coast Stadium; and Western Sydney Wanderers in 2013 also hosting at Sydney Football Stadium instead of Parramatta Stadium.

=== A-League Men Young Footballer of the Year ===
The A-League Men Young Footballer of the Year is an annual association football award given to the player aged 23 or under at the start of the season who has been judged to have had the best season of any young player in the A-League Men. It is currently called the NAB Young Footballer of the Year for sponsorship purposes. The award has been presented since the 2005–06 season and the winner is chosen by a panel of experts and media representatives. In 2014, the age for eligibility was lifted from 21 to 23.  The first winner of the award was Perth Glory midfielder Nick Ward.
As of 2017, Mathew Ryan and Jamie Maclaren are the only players to have won the award on more than one occasion. Marco Rojas and Alex Paulsen are the only non-Australian winners of the trophy. Players aged 23 or under at the start of the season remain eligible to win the Johnny Warren Medal, and in 2013 Rojas won both awards.
Since 2009, one player has been awarded a nomination for the award each month of the season, with the eventual winner then selected from the nominees.
In 2024, the award was awarded to two players for the first time, with Nestory Irankunda and Paulsen tying.

The award has been presented on 19 occasions as of 2024, with 18 different winners.

=== A-League Men finals series ===
The A-League Men finals series is a playoff tournament held at the end of each A-League Men season to determine the champion. The top six teams qualify for the finals based on the home-and-away season results, culminating in the A-League Men Grand Final.


== Inception ==
Finals series began back in the National Soccer League era from the 1984 season onwards, and has been consistently played (except the 1987 season) in every Australian national league season to date. With the A-League Men starting with eight teams, top four play-offs were used for the first three seasons, before changing to top six play-offs as more clubs entered the competition.


=== Systems ===
The A-League Men has used four different finals tournament systems in its history:

2006–2009 (top four) – Page playoff system
2010–2012 (top six) – Top-six play-offs (four weeks, double chance)
2013–2021 (top six) – Top-six play-offs (three weeks, no double chance)
2022–present (top six) – Top-six play-offs (four weeks, no double chance)


== History ==
The first edition of the A-League Men finals series was played at the culmination of the 2005–06 A-League season, beginning with the top four teams from the league ladder qualifying using a modified Page playoff system, with the difference that each first-round game would be played over two legs          starting with the modified Page playoff system. Sydney FC claimed the first A-League Men championship, by defeating the Central Coast Mariners 1–0 in the Grand Final, despite Adelaide United winning the premiership prior.
The same playoff systems were used the next few editions from 2007 to 2009. After four straight years the finals series adapted a new modified system for top-six play-offs in 2010, with the amount of finals teams being increased from four to six; meaning the introduction of the elimination-finals for the lower finishing finals teams. Even so, it was uncommon for elimination finals teams to reach the Grand Final for most editions with this playoffs system. Perth Glory were the first to reach the Grand Final from starting at the elimination-finals in 2012.
A new top-six playoffs system was introduced and has been used ever since 2013, where a three-week series was used instead of four and the top two teams no longer receive a double chance. Instead they received the opening week of the finals series off and only needed to win one game to make the Grand Final. Around this time, Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Brisbane Roar had been hosting grand finals ever since the first season of the A-League as the most efficient performers in the finals series. Since this current playoffs system was introduced, semi-final starting teams were common in being the only teams to qualify for the Grand Final until 2018, where Melbourne Victory played in the 2018 A-League Grand Final after qualifying from fourth place spot and the elimination-finals. Western United are the only other team to play in a Grand Final starting from the elimination-finals in 2022, since this current playoffs system. Since the 2021–22 season a two-legged semi final rule was introduced.


== Venues ==
Finals matches are played in the state of the home team, giving a home state advantage to the higher placed team; the exceptions of this rule occurred in the 2020 finals series, where all matches were played at Western Sydney Stadium in Parramatta, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. 
The 2023 A-League Men Grand Final involved the grand final being played at a neutral venue, following an APL decision to host 2023, 2024 and 2025 Grand Finals in Sydney in a deal with Destination NSW, a move which received considerable backlash in December 2022 and scrapped in October 2023.

=== A-League Pre-season Challenge Cup ===
The A-League Pre-season Challenge Cup competition was an annual soccer tournament held for all A-League clubs in July and August in the lead up to the start of the A-League season. The competition featured a group stage and a knockout stage. Commentators did not give much weight to the competition as a guide for performance during the season proper, as injuries or club strategic policy ruled that many teams did not use their best players and often used experimental tactics. The Pre-Season Cup was removed from the 2009–10 A-League schedule in order to give the clubs more control over their own pre-season training.


== History ==


=== 2005–2006 ===
The inaugural A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup was won by Central Coast Mariners after they beat the reigning NSL Champions, Perth Glory 1–0 in the grand final. The event was a huge success and attracted clubs to thoroughly prepare for their A-League endeavours.
The second edition of the Pre-Season Cup was used to enhance the A-League's profiles by playing pre-season games in regional centres including the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba, Launceston, Canberra, Wollongong, Port Macquarie, Orange and Tamworth. A new format allowed matches for: third, fifth and seventh place as well as a grand final. A trophy was given to the teams that finished first, second and third. Adelaide United won the Grand Final after beating reigning champions Central Coast Mariners 5–4 on penalties after 1–1 at the end of extra time. Sydney FC finished in third place.


=== 2007–2008 ===
The 2007 edition had an identical format as the 2006 edition, it was won by Adelaide United after they came back from 1–0 down to win the game 2–1, 9,606 spectators attended the grand final and just over 3,500 spectators attended the third place play-off where Brisbane Roar beat Central Coast Mariners 3–1 after the Roar received two red cards during the match.
Bunbury, Caloundra, Cessnock, Mandurah and Mount Gambier all hosted matches for the first time.  The Format changed again, the third, fifth and seventh place matches were removed and the top team from each group played each other instead of the regular knockout format.  Melbourne Victory won the last ever A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup after beating Wellington Phoenix 8–7 in a penalty shoot-out after a 0–0 score at the end of extra time.


== Format ==
In the Pre-Season Cup, the teams were evenly placed into two groups. Each team played the others in the group once over three rounds.
Beginning in 2006, an additional bonus round was then held, with each team playing a cross-over match with a team from a different group. In addition to the standard points (3 for a win, 1 for a draw), there were special bonus points on offer for the bonus round matches:

1 bonus point for 2 goals scored by a team,
2 bonus points for 3 goals scored by a team, or
3 bonus points for 4 or more goals scored by a team.
4 bonus points for scoring 5 goals by a player.
This format was edited for the 2007 competition. The bonus round was removed, and the bonus points system introduced into each of the first three rounds. All eight teams then entered a knock-out round, culminating in the final in late August.

=== A-League Women ===
A-League Women (currently known as the Ninja A-League for sponsorship reasons), formerly the W-League, is the top-division women's soccer league in Australia. The W-League was established in 2008 by Football Australia (then known as Football Federation Australia) and was originally composed of eight teams of which seven had an affiliation with an existing A-League Men's club. As of the 2022–23 season, the league is contested by twelve teams. The league, as well as the A-League Men and A-League Youth are administered by the Australian Professional Leagues.
Seasons now run from November to April and include a 23-round regular season and an end-of-season finals series playoff tournament involving the highest-placed teams, culminating in a Grand Final match. The winner of the regular season tournament is dubbed "premiers" and the winner of the grand final is dubbed "champions". The premiers qualify for the AFC Women's Champions League, starting from the 2024–25 season.
Since the league's inaugural season, a total of five clubs have been crowned premiers and five clubs have been crowned champions. It has been currently running on a semi-professional basis, but talks about professionalisation have been emerging, beginning with the name change and placing of all women's clubs into one single Australian Professional Leagues operation and management in 2021, which served as the precursors for complete transition to professionalism of the A-League Women.
Melbourne City are the current premiers, having won their fourth title; Central Coast Mariners are the current champions, having won their first title.


== History ==

Between 1996 and 2004 the Women's National Soccer League (WNSL) was Australia's top women's soccer league. In 2004 it was discontinued alongside the men's National Soccer League.
After Australia qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, head coach Tom Sermanni felt the establishment of a professional league was vital for continuing the development of players. Football Federation Australia established the league the following year. The W-League was initially composed of eight teams: Adelaide United, Brisbane Roar, Central Coast Mariners, Melbourne Victory, Newcastle Jets, Perth Glory, and Sydney FC. Seven of the eight teams were affiliated with A-League clubs, and shared their names and colours to promote their brands. The eighth club was Canberra United.
The W-League's inaugural season commenced on 25 October 2008, with Perth hosting Sydney at Members Equity Stadium. After ten rounds, the regular season finished with Queensland Roar as the top-placed team, becoming the first W-League premiers, and advancing to the semi-finals along with the second-, third- and fourth-placed teams. Queensland faced Canberra in the 2009 W-League grand final, defeating them 2–0 to take the champions trophy.
Central Coast Mariners were forced to withdraw from the 2010–11 season due to a lack of funding, but returned in 2023–24.
When Western Sydney Wanderers joined the A-League for the 2012–13 season, they also entered a team into the W-League, returning the competition to eight teams. From 2012 to 2014, the W-League champion team qualified into an international competition, the International Women's Club Championship.
On 13 May 2015, Melbourne City were confirmed to compete in the W-League from the 2015–16 season. The club had a remarkable inaugural season, winning all 12 of its regular season games and winning the Grand Final.
From the inception of the competition the league was run by Football Federation Australia, the governing body for the sport in Australia. In July 2019, the FFA relinquished operational control of the league to each of the clubs, now represented by the Australian Professional Leagues.
The league commenced a further expansion program starting in 2021, with Wellington Phoenix commencing in the 2021–22 season, Western United for the 2022–23 season, and Central Coast Mariners for the 2023–24 season. Future expansion is planned for the 2025–26 season, after the award of a licence for an Auckland-based team for both A-League Men and Women.
Crowds have improved remarkably in 2023, on the back of the Matildas performance in the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The record A-League Women's crowd (including finals) was set on 14 October 2023, with the match between Sydney FC and the Western Sydney Wanderers drawing a crowd of 11,471.
Around 15 April 2024, the 2023–24 A-League Women season become the most attended season of any women's sport in Australian history by recording a total attendance of 284,551; the season finished with a final total attendance of 312,199.


== Competition format ==
The A-League Women regular season typically runs from November to April and consists of 23 games per team (22 home and away, plus one additional "Unite Round" fixture), with the highest ranked team winning the title of "Premier". The top six teams in the regular season then advance to the knockout finals series (single elimination finals, two-legged semi-finals), with the Champion determined by the victor of the Grand Final.
On 12 December 2022, the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) announced that the grand finals for the 2022–23 and two subsequent seasons would be hosted in Sydney, a move which received considerable backlash. On 18 October 2023, the APL announced that the Grand Final hosting rights would revert back to the original format, and instead a new "Unite Round" was introduced, with a regular season round having all its games played in Sydney.


== Special events ==


=== Pride Round ===
Pride Cup is an Australian organisation dedicated to advocating for the LGBTQIA+ community in sport. It was founded in 2012 after former Australian rules footballer Jason Ball came out publicly as gay, and his club in Yarra Glen, Victoria showed their support by staging a "Pride Cup". This led to the establishment of the annual AFL Pride Game in 2016, and the idea soon spread to other codes. After Adelaide United player Josh Cavallo became the first openly gay top-flight male footballer in October 2021, the A-League partnered with A-League Women to stage a single Pride men's and women's doubleheader during the 2021-22 season.
On 24–26 February 2023, both the A-League Men and Women's competitions staged their first-ever Pride Round, the first occasion in which the leagues had "come together to recognise and promote inclusion for the LGBTQIA+ community". Part proceeds from ticket sales across all of the round's fixtures were donated to Pride Cup. In 2024, the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) announced the continuation of the round, as well as providing inclusion training to all players and key stakeholders. The A-Leagues would be collaborating with the PFA and Pride Cup, who would help to deliver the training. The annual Pride Cup double-header between Adelaide United and Melbourne Victory would take place in March, and several men's and women's teams would celebrate by engaging community groups and using indicators such as rainbow corner flags, armbands, special Pride kit and/or rainbow socks.


=== Unite Round ===
Since the 2023–24 season the Australian Professional Leagues has held a "Unite Round". During this round, all matches are held in a single city. The round is currently in partnership with Destination NSW, and was introduced after the Grand Final decision was reversed in October 2023.


== Clubs ==


=== Performance record ===
Performance and ranking of clubs based on their best regular season result in the W-League and A-League Women.


== Organisation ==


=== Squad formation and salaries ===

An A-League Women squad is required to have a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 26 players. Players typically receive a one-season contract, with many playing in leagues in other countries during the A-League Women off-season.  Due to the A-League Women season running during the off-season of several leagues around the world, many foreign players have played for teams in A-League Women and vice versa.
In 2015, teams in what was then the W-League had a salary cap of A$150,000. Individual player salaries varied, with one player reporting to The Sydney Morning Herald in 2012 that whilst some players earned A$10,000, others earned nothing. In 2014, it was reported that Sydney FC players were paid salaries ranging from $1,000 to $6,000. Players could also earn money playing overseas and may therefore be considered by Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) as professional.
Some clubs are owned by their state soccer associations, including Adelaide United and Newcastle Jets.
For the 2017–18 season a minimum salary was introduced at A$10,000. The average salary therefore rose from A$15,500 to A$17,400. A salary cap was set at A$300,000.
The total salary floor, or minimum salary spend, for the 2020-21 season rose to A$294,000, growing to A$315,000 in the 2021-22 season, with a salary cap of A$450,000, as part of a five-year deal that woulf see the salary floor rise to A$390,000 by 2025-26. The deal also included improved standards in training venues, travel and accommodation, high performance staffing, and player workloads. The A-League Women minimum annual wage in 2021 was A$17,055. This increased to A$25,000 in 2023 owing to the extended season, which was a full home-and-away schedule for the first time. As of March 2024, players are contracted for 35 weeks for a 22-round regular season, with four extra weeks for those playing in the finals.
A 2023 survey showed that most players in the league work and/or study part-time, having to supplement their part-time income. According to the PFA, most players "earned at or close to the minimum" in the previous season, with around 60 per cent of players having had to work second jobs; by way of comparison, only 15 per cent of A-League Men were working second jobs, with the vast majority of those working fewer than 10 hours per week. After the success of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, there were renewed calls to make the competition a full-time one.


=== Branding ===

The competition was known as the Westfield W-League from its inception in 2008 until 2021, under an agreement with Westfield as the naming rights sponsor. The main logo design was shared with the A-League men's competition. In 2017, Football Australia undertook a major rebranding and redesigned its logos for the W-League and A-League to be in line with its own logo, and those of its member federations.
After governance of the league was handed to the Australian Professional Leagues in 2020, there was another rebranding in September 2021, which saw the competition being renamed to A-League Women. Liberty Financial became the league's new naming rights sponsor shortly afterwards in December 2021 and the competition was then known as the Liberty A-League Women. Since September 2024, the league is known as Ninja A-League Women with home appliances company SharkNinja as the current naming rights sponsor.


=== Stadiums ===

A-League Women games have been played in 91 venues since the inaugural season of the A-League.


== Broadcasting ==
The 2018–19 season marked the first time that fans were able to watch every W-League game. All matches were broadcast or streamed on Fox Sports, SBS Viceland and the My Football Live app. Thursday Night Football was also introduced, meaning 13 stand-alone regular season matches will be played in prime-time and broadcast live on Fox Sports. The Football Federation Australia (FFA) reached a deal with ESPN+ for broadcast rights to W-League games in the United States. ESPN+ will carry at least 17 W-League matches in the 2018–19 season. For the first time ever W-League games would be broadcast on YouTube and Twitter in territories without a traditional broadcast partner.
In the 2019–20 season, ABC TV broadcast one game per weekend. Fourteen rounds of that season were broadcast at 4pm on Sundays, as well as the whole W-League 2020 Finals Series. Fox Sport's contract with the A-League, which was renegotiated in June 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, concluded in July 2021.
From July 2019 to the end of the 2020–21 season, Foxtel broadcast all matches with ABC broadcasting one match per round live on its primary channel.
Since August 2021, as part of a five-year deal with ViacomCBS, the A-Leagues have been broadcast by Network 10 and Paramount+ (Australia) streaming service. As of the 2022–23 season, Paramount and Network 10's free-to-access streaming service 10Play stream all matches.
In New Zealand, A-League Men and A-League Women matches are broadcast on Sky Sport / beIN Sports.

=== A-League Youth ===
A-League Youth, formerly known as the National Youth League and Y-League is a defunct Australian national soccer youth developmental and under-21s league, founded by Football Federation Australia and later run by the Australian Professional Leagues. The current league was established as a successor to the previous competition of the National Youth League (1984–2004) and commenced in August 2008. The league runs in conjunction with the A-League Men as a developmental or reserve league. The league, as well as the A-League Men and A-League Women are administered by the Australian Professional Leagues.
In 2020 it was contested by ten teams, all of which competed in the A-League. From the 2020–21 season, the league was to expand to eleven teams with the introduction of Western United, however the season was cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.
Following the end of COVID restrictions the league did not return, and the clubs now focus on their development through their entries in the National Premier Leagues system in each state. The new system benefits the clubs by removing the expensive interstate travel, and exposes the players to a tougher level of competition over a longer period with more matches.


== History ==


=== Foundation ===
A previous league under the same name, the National Youth League was an Australian national soccer league run in parallel to the National Soccer League (NSL) between 1984 and 2004.
The current league was announced by Football Federation Australia at the start of March 2008. It was set up in conjunction with the A-League in order to continue to develop young Australian talent into the league as well as into the Australian national team and its affiliates such as the under 17, under 20 and under 23 teams. The league's inaugural season was made up of seven teams, each linked to the corresponding Australian club in the A-League (excluding Wellington Phoenix) and had strong links to players training at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). The 2009–10 season saw the addition of Gold Coast United and a team from the Australian Institute of Sport Football Program.


=== Expansion ===
In the 2012–13 season, Gold Coast United were replaced by Western Sydney Wanderers. In April 2017, the closing of the FFA Centre of Excellence (previously the Australian Institute of Sport Football Program) was announced. Before the 2017–18 season, it was announced that Canberra United were granted a National Youth League licence.
All players in the youth teams are between the ages of 16 and 21 as of the start of the calendar year for each new season, while four over-age players from each of the senior teams are also allowed to be selected.
The competition was renamed "A-League Youth" to align with other Australian national competitions in September 2021.


== Competition format ==
Each club contracts a squad of 16 Youth Development Players. Players must be between the ages of 16 and 23 as of 1 January in the year the season commences. Four over-age players (including goalkeeper) are also allowed to be selected (except when playing the AIS where it is restricted to two), usually these coming from the senior team. Each youth player must receive a minimum of 30 minutes game time. Players under 21 signed for the first team filling foreign player spots are classed as over-age players. These players can be any Australian player within the age group. A-League clubs must draw replacement players for their senior teams from the Youth League squad, except under certain circumstances. Such would include severe injuries to over-age players where an injury replacement player is able to be signed.


=== Original format ===
Up until and including the 2014–15 season the league had an 18-round format with every team playing all other teams Home and Away. In previous seasons an end-of-season finals series playoff tournament was played between the highest-placed teams from the regular season, culminating in the Grand Final game. The aim of a league is to provide a pathway for young players and state league players to play regular high-level football, and allow reserve players from senior A-League teams to remain match fit.


=== Introduction of conferences ===
From the 2015–16 season a new format was introduced.  From 2016, all A-League clubs now have youth teams entered into their local conferences of the National Premier Leagues.  By having NPL teams, there is now less reliance on the A-League Youth to provide an avenue for youth players to their respective clubs. There was also pressure from A-League clubs to reduce travel budgets.  As such the season was shortened from 18 games per team to 8 games plus a Grand Final.  The existing ten A-League Youth teams were divided into two conferences of five teams: Conference A consisted of teams from WA, SA, Victoria and Queensland, while teams from ACT and NSW were in Conference B.  All teams play all other teams in their conference on a home and away basis. After the home and away series a Grand Final is played between the top teams from each conference.


== Clubs ==
12 clubs have played in the A-League Youth from its inception in 2008, up to and including the 2019–20 season.
The following 10 clubs competed in the Y-League during the 2019–20 season.

The Y-League was founded in 2008. The number of teams in the league has ranged from seven to ten during its history, and there are currently ten clubs in the league. The award is given to the top-scorer over the regular season (not including the finals series/grand final).
Francesco Monterosso is the only player to have won the award on multiple occasions.

=== A-Lex ===
A-Lex is the eleventh studio album by the Brazilian metal band Sepultura. It was released on January 23, 2009 by independent German record label SPV. This is the first album featuring drummer Jean Dolabella, since the departure of Igor Cavalera in 2006.
This is the second concept album released by Sepultura, following 2006's Dante XXI which was based on Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy. A-Lex is based on the 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess, which was adapted into a film version by Stanley Kubrick in 1971.


== Album information ==
The album was recorded in São Paulo at Trama Studios and mixed at Mega Studios during 2008, since February through the process of composition until August when the band finished the mixing process and revealed the track listing and album title.
Guitarist Andreas Kisser stated about the influences obtained from Burgess work:

We will write our soundtrack for this story and Burgess' life will be an inspiration also to write the music, lyrics and for the artwork.
The title is a pun on the main character from the novel, Alex, and the Latin for "without law": a (without) + lex (law); presumably referring to how Alex and his companions behaved.
A-Lex is available in three versions: a deluxe digipak with an embossed cover, a regular jewel case and on a vinyl gate-fold LP. On January 16, 2009, the album was released for exclusive listening on last.fm.


== Music videos ==
Two music videos have been made for the album. The first, "We've Lost You!", was filmed in São Paulo, Brazil, and was released in February 2009. A video for "What I Do!" was released in May 2009. Sepultura performed on the A-Lex World Tour 2009 in Europe and North America.


== Reception ==

A-Lex received positive reviews. New drummer Jean Dolabella, who replaced Igor Cavalera, was well received by fans and media. AllMusic gave A-Lex 4 stars out of 5 and called it a "vicious, loud sledgehammer of an album". Alternative Press (p. 108) gave it 3.5 stars out of 5 and said, "A-Lex deftly fuses the band's many stylistic phases, from the thrash and death metal that launched their career to later explorations of punk, hardcore, groove metal and even tribal rhythms." Record Collector (p. 103) gave it 3 stars out of 5 and said, "Much closer to a live, hardcore punk sound than the refined digital crunch of their previous records... As ever with Sepultura, Kisser's slick riffage and the visceral drums are the point."
A-Lex sold 5,000 copies in its first week of release in Brazil and 1,600 in its first week of release in the United States. It was considered by the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone as one of the Top 25 Brazilian albums of 2012.

=== A-Lin ===
Lisang Pacidal Koyouan (Chinese: 黃麗玲; pinyin: Huáng Lìlíng; born 20 September 1983), better known by her stage name A-Lin, is a Taiwanese singer and songwriter of Amis descent. She made her debut in February 2006 under Avex Taiwan with the studio album Lovelorn, Not Guilty.


== Career ==
In 1999, when A-Lin was 16 years old and taught children to sing the hymn "Amazing Grace" after the 1999 Jiji earthquake in Nantou County, she was discovered by her former agent. However, he was not available when she wanted to give him contact information. Fortunately, four years later, A-Lin met him again in a bar where she sang regularly. She was officially offered a singing contract.
A-Lin made her debut in the world of music at the end of 2006, achieving rapid commercial success. She has been called the next A-Mei, who is an aboriginal singer of Puyuma descent. She also got the nickname 天生歌姬, meaning "A Born Diva". A-Lin was often quoted as saying that A-Mei is highly influential to her music and often covers A-Mei's songs in music shows and concerts. A-Lin has won numerous music awards and is extremely popular within Mandarin-speaking world.
A-Lin has performed internationally and at a sold-out concert with Xiao Yu and Shin in 2012 at the Sydney Town Hall. It was her first visit to Sydney and people flew in from different cities just to see her. In 2013, with Avex Taiwan exiting the market due to overall poor sales from the records, all singers under Avex like Huang Li-ling were allowed to terminate their contracts early.
After terminating her contract, A-Lin signed with her new label Sony Music. In December 2014, she released her first album after leaving Avex. This album was nominated for Best Mandarin Female Singer, making her fourth nomination without any win.
In 2015, she participated in the third season of I Am a Singer and came in sixth on the finale held in March 2015. As a result, her singing ability was recognized by more people and provided a boost to her career.


== Style ==
While A-Lin considers herself as a Contralto, she has been noted to have an extremely wide vocal range closely identical to that of Amanda Seyfried, as noted in many of her songs to have over two octaves or more, and in the concert in Auckland, New Zealand, she was suffering from illnesses that made her unable to hit her falsetto range. She has also notably performed "Remember", by A-Mei, in infantile speech.


== Personal life ==
A-Lin is the youngest in her family. Her parents are Roman Catholics and love music. A-Lin's older sister is Taiwanese model Luji Huang, who entered the Super Star competition in Taiwan in July 2013 as an aspiring singer in her own right. In 2015, after A-Lin entered I Am A Singer, Lea became a contestant for 'The most beautiful harmonies' (最美和聲). They also have an older brother, and A-Lin's cousin-in-law is her fitness coach and also a guitarist. A-Lin was extremely popular as a student and the confidence she gained from this led to her decision to compete in a 'Singing Strength Elite Rivalry Competition' [歌唱實力精英角逐比賽]. She chose the hit song 'At least you are still there' [至少還有你], by Sandy Lam, and the competition allowed A-Lin to believe she had a future as a professional singer. In reference to talent shows being readily accessible to young people these days, A-Lin commented, "I am impressed that there is now a Million Star-type of singing platform, which allows both everyone who enjoys singing and those who are talented singers a tough but realistic chance – an accomplished dream." They also have a brother.
On 1 July 2007, A-Lin married Huang Kan-lin, a well-known Taiwanese baseball player. They have a daughter, Huang Qiaoyu. (A-Lin said: "At the first time Huang Kan-lin requested a song "How Do I Live"  by LeAnn Rimes in her Tainan Pub Session. However, at that time because of his poor English, he wrote "Good Do A-Lin" on a piece of paper and then spelled the song in homophonic Mandarin. The implication was that he wanted to chase after A-Lin because of her rich lips. Eventually, Huang Kan-lin proposed to A-Lin successfully by a new recorded song "愛情問怎麼走 (How Love Will Go)").

=== A-Line (Hamilton) ===
The A-Line is a proposed rapid transit line running along James Street in downtown and Upper James Street on the escarpment in Hamilton, Ontario. It is part of Hamilton's formerly proposed BLAST network, now known as the (Re)envision the HSR project, involving five other rapid transit corridors. It was previously identified by Metrolinx in its regional transportation plan The Big Move as a project to be completed by 2023. The route is currently served by Hamilton Street Railway's Route 20 A-Line Express bus.


== History ==
During planning, both bus rapid transit (BRT) and light rail transit (LRT) were considered for the corridor. On May 26, 2015, the Government of Ontario announced the B-Line LRT would be constructed between McMaster University and Queenston Circle, as well as a short LRT segment of the A-Line to provide a direct connection to West Harbour GO Station from King Street.
On February 2, 2017, the province removed the 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) A-Line LRT spur from the B-Line construction scope. In its stead, the province proposed advancing the planning and environmental assessment of a 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) BRT along the entire A-Line corridor, from Hamilton's waterfront to Hamilton Airport. 
On March 8, 2018, Metrolinx released the 2041 Regional Transportation Plan (2041 RTP) for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), superseding the previous RTP completed ten years earlier (The Big Move). The 2041 RTP recommends removing the waterfront portion of the corridor and constructing a BRT from West Harbour GO to Rymal Road and a "Priority Bus" from Rymal Road to Hamilton Airport.  
On July 19, 2021, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments announced funding for upgrades to the A-Line corridor. The proposed works include construction of five queue jump lines and 17 km (11 mi) of sidewalks, implementation of transit signal priority measures at select intersections, and improvements to approximately 19 transit stops along the corridor. Construction of dedicated BRT lanes were not included in the funding announcement.

=== A-Love ===
A-Love is a female Australian-based MC from Melbourne. Her debut album, Ace of Hearts was nominated 'Best Urban Release' in the ARIA Music Awards of 2008.


== Biography ==
A-Love was born Antonella Formosa in Rome, Italy on 21 March 1983.  Formosa's father is Ric Formosa, a composer/arranger and an original member (lead guitarist) with the Australian band Little River Band and her mother, Vicki Formosa, was an R&B singer.My earliest memories are of my Dad carting me around to different studios to these sessions, and playing on pool tables in old studios.
She attended Hawthorn Secondary College, graduating in 1999. Whilst her first experiences of playing music were with an all-female band, which never made any public performances, she also discovered hip hop in high school and soon found herself waxing lyrical over beats.Rest assured, if I was a better singer, I'd be a soul singer! [MCing] was just something that I fell in love with in my teens. I've always been heavily into lyricism, no matter what kind of musical style I've been interested in. The fact that hip hop let you just not mince words and be really direct and cram so much more content and originality into your lyrics than singing was the biggest thing for me.
In January 2000, Formosa met Draino from the Puah Hedz.  He was keen to check out her writing and despite her reluctance, he made her feature on a track. The second track that she had ever recorded was with Muphin, which later became "Some People" which featured on the album Despite the Odds. She has since appeared numerous times on Triple J's 'The Hip Hop Show', PBS' 'The Formula' (now 'Hittin Switches') and 'Auscultation', RRR's 'Wordburner' and RMIT University's SRA FM.  She was progressing towards a Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology from La Trobe University and for two years she was the co-host of a hip hop radio show at La Trobe University.
May 2002 marked A-Love's official solo introduction to the Australian hip hop and media circles, with her song "Petty" from the album, Culture of Kings Volume 2 (the first ever Australian hip hop feature album on Triple J).  "Petty" was put on medium rotation on Triple J.
Formosa was a winner of the Nescafe Big Break competition in 2002, earning $20,000 with which to start up an independent record label and distribution company, Duality Records. As time progressed, she juggled the twin responsibilities of building a label and working on her own debut as an artist.

I really concentrated on getting the admin and strategic side of the label going, but it just proved to be a bit too hard. I knew that it was either gonna be the music that went or the label – which is where we are now.
Formosa released her debut album, Ace of Hearts on 24 November 2007, on Crookneck Records.  The album was produced by BVA (Mnemonic Ascent) with additional beats from Suffa (Hilltop Hoods) and Jase. Guests include Yungun (UK), Raph (Mnemonic Ascent), Spikey Tee (UK) and emerging indigenous MC Jim Blah.  It was Triple J's 'Album of the Week' just three days after its release and was nominated for the 2008 ARIA Awards in the category of 'Best Urban Release'.The minute that I stepped in the studio with BVA I knew the time was right to record this album. I felt hungry and inspired again, it all fell in place. The result is a bunch of songs with lasting sentiment; real stories about real life.
She was also nominated for two at the Jägermeister AIR (Australian Independent Record Labels Association) Awards in 2008, in the categories of 'Best New Independent Artist' and 'Best Independent Hip Hop Artist'.
Formosa has performed with Mystik Journeymen (US), Anticon, Hilltop Hoods, Pegz, MC Layla, Kowhai, Bliss n Eso, Scarz on 45, MC Que, TZU, Bias B and DJ Brand (Canada).

=== A-MAC ===
In television electronics, A-MAC carries digital information: sound, and data-teletext on an FM subcarrier at 7 MHz. Since the vision bandwidth of a standard MAC signal is 8.4 MHz, the horizontal resolution on A-MAC has to be reduced to make room for the 7 MHz carrier. A-MAC has not been used in service.


== Technical details ==
MAC transmits luminance and chrominance data separately in time rather than separately in frequency (as other analog television formats do, such as composite video).
Audio and Scrambling (selective access)

Audio, in a format similar to NICAM was transmitted digitally rather than as an FM subcarrier.
The MAC standard included a standard scrambling system, EuroCrypt, a precursor to the standard DVB-CSA encryption system.

=== A-Ma Temple ===
The A-Má Temple is a temple to the Chinese sea-goddess Mazu located in São Lourenço, Macau, China. Built in 1488, the temple is one of the oldest in Macau and thought to be the settlement's namesake.


== History ==
The name Macau was thought to be derived from the name of the temple. See Hokkien Chinese: 阿媽; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: a-má; lit. 'grandmother', 'elderly woman'; Cantonese Chinese: 阿媽; Jyutping: aa3 maa5; Cantonese Yale: a máh; lit. 'an epithet of the Fujianese sea goddess Matsu (媽祖)'. It is said that when the Portuguese sailors landed at the coast just outside the temple and asked the name of the place, the natives replied A-maa-gok (Cantonese Chinese: 阿媽閣; Jyutping: aa3 maa5 gok3; Cantonese Yale: a máh gok; lit. 'Pavilion of the Fujianese sea goddess Matsu (媽祖)'; Hokkien Chinese: 阿媽閣; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: A-má Koh; lit. 'Ornamental Platform of the Grandmother') or Maa-gok (Cantonese Chinese: 媽閣; Jyutping: maa5 gok3; Cantonese Yale: máh gok; lit. 'Pavilion of the Mother'). The Portuguese then named the peninsula with various forms over the centuries such as "Amacão", "Ama Cuão", "amaquan", "Amacao", "Amacuão", "Amaquão", "Amangão", "Amagão", "Amaquam", then the initial ⟨A⟩ was later elided in Portuguese likely due to misconstruing with Portuguese: a, lit. 'towards; to; at; in' resulting into the following forms, "Macão", "Macao", "Macau", "Maquão", "Maçhoam", "Machoam". The temple was well described in ancient Chinese texts as well as represented in paintings, related to Macao. It is also one of the first scenes photographed in Macao.
In 2005, the temple became one of the designated sites of the Historic Centre of Macau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


== Architecture ==
The temple consists of six main parts: Gate Pavilion, the Memorial Arch, the Prayer Hall, the Hall of Benevolence (the oldest part of the temple), the Hall of Guanyin, Zhengjiao Chanlin - Buddhist Pavilion.

=== A-Mei ===
Kulilay Amit (Chinese: 張惠妹; pinyin: Zhāng Huìmèi; born 9 August 1972), better known by her stage name A-Mei, is a Taiwanese singer and record producer of Puyuma descent. Born as Amit Kulilay in eastern Taiwan, she made her debut in 1996. A leading figure of the Mandopop music scene since the mid-1990s, A-Mei is widely known as a groundbreaker for Taiwanese indigenous peoples and a voice for LGBT rights and gender equality. She has been given the moniker "Queen of Mandopop" and the "Pride of Taiwan." Her career longevity, resilience, artistry, and versatility have established her as a pop culture icon in the Sinophone world.
Born and raised in Beinan, Taitung, Taiwan, A-Mei moved to Taipei at age 20 in 1992. In 1996, she released her debut studio album, Sisters, which saw major commercial success and sold over a million copies in Taiwan. Her sophomore record, Bad Boy (1997), found even greater success, eventually becoming the country's best-selling album overall. Her follow up releases—Holding Hands (1998), Can I Hug You, Lover? (1999) and Regardless (2000)—received critical and commercial acclaim, with the first two albums also selling well over a million copies. A cross-straits controversy caused her to experience a decline in sales in 2004; she would later experience a resurgence in 2006 with her album I Want Happiness?.
Her albums Truth (2001), Amit (2009), and Faces of Paranoia (2014) each won her a Golden Melody Award for Best Mandarin Female Singer, making her one of the singers who won the category the most times. Having sold over 50 million records, A-Mei is the best-selling female artist in Taiwanese music history. She is recognized as having the influence and cultural impact in the Sinophone world, equivalent to artists such as Madonna in Western music and popular culture. In 2017, she was included in the "Charity Heroes List" by the Asian edition of Forbes, and her influence is even greater than that of many famous Taiwanese political and business figures.


== Life and career ==


=== 1972–1995: Early years and musical beginnings ===
A-Mei was born on 9 August 1972 in the Tamalakaw tribe (belonging to the Puyuma) in Beinan, Taitung, Taiwan. Her Puyuma-language name is Kulilay Amit, alternatively transliterated Gulilai Amit. She was the seventh child in a family of nine children.  During her childhood A-Mei's family was impoverished, making it increasingly difficult to raise so many offspring. To support the family, the father originally wanted to give A-Mei and her younger sister Saya Chang to relatives for adoption. It was A-Mei's mother who took them to hide deep in the mountains to escape the fate of being adopted. Despite avoiding the fate of being separated from her family, A-Mei's upbringing was still quite difficult due to always being short on money. Although A-Mei couldn't receive formal training in music and stage performances, she showed her love for stage singing performances since she was a child. Like most Native Taiwanese people, she was exposed to tribal music very early on. Her mother used to record herself singing, then play it back on tape for her daughters to hear. A-Mei had always been fascinated by music, saying that she was addicted to the radio and would rush to watch the late night music programs that introduced her to English songs when she was a child. Oftentimes she summoned the children in the village and persuaded everyone to use flashlights to create "stage lighting effects" for her. In addition to her talent in music, A-Mei was also very good at sports. In elementary school, under the careful guidance of coach Shi Shunxiong, she earned a second-degree black belt and once represented her school in a taekwondo competition.
In 1992 A-Mei left her hometown of Taitung for the first time to work in a restaurant and sell clothes at a roadside stand in Taipei. She first connected to the entertainment business by joining the televised "Five Lights Singing Contest" on TTV Main Channel in 1992 after encouragement from her father. She made it all the way through to the finals but lost in the final round.
She was disappointed and was almost ready to give up interest in music competitions. A-Mei's father then told her, "You definitely can sing, and you perform songs beautifully. Why don't you enter the competition again to show that you have a talent for music?" So, encouraged by the kind words from her father, she attended the singing contest again in 1993. Her performances enchanted the judges and she was crowned champion the following year. Unfortunately her father didn't live to see her victory due to him succumbing to his illness, leaving A-Mei devastated. Years later in 2009 when she released an album for the first time under her real name Amit, she sung the song "Disappear (掉了)" which expresses how dearly she misses him. After winning the Taiwan TV Five Lights Awards program, he was invited by Japan Asia Airways to go to Japan to perform at the "World Music Tour" in Tokyo.
After her father's death, A-Mei struggled to recall her passion for music until 1995 when she began to sing in local pubs with a rock band called "Relax" which was formed by her musician cousin. Her pub performance impressed Taiwanese music producer Chang Yu-sheng and Chang Hsiao-yen, the head of Taiwanese record label Forward Music at the time; she signed a recording deal with Forward Music in March 1996.


=== 1996–1997: Career beginnings, Sisters, and Bad Boy ===
After she signed a recording deal with Forward Music she made an appearance on Chang Yu-sheng's album, Red Passion, which was released on 12 July 1996, where they sang a duet titled "The One Who Loved Me Most, Hurt Me The Most (最愛的人傷我最深)." In November 1996, when A-Mei was invited to sing "I'm a Dreamer on Air (空中的夢想家)," the theme song for Taiwan's UFO Radio station, she again drew attention from the public. On 13 December 1996, A-Mei released her debut album Sisters, which she made under the tutelage of Chang. Originally, the head honchos at Forward Music worried that A-Mei's aboriginal heritage would have a negative impact on the album's sales due to discrimination against aboriginal people still being widespread at the time. In spite of this, A-Mei still emphasized to the media that she was from an aboriginal background and was the very first Taiwanese mainstream pop star to proudly flaunt her aboriginal identity. On the contrary, the album Sisters became a runaway success. The album topped the Taiwan IFPI chart for nine consecutive weeks and sold a total of 1.21 million copies in Taiwan and four million in Asia. The sales result for Sisters surprised Forward Music, since they had no expectations of it being so well-received, who even forgot to sign her up for the 8th Golden Melody Awards  (the Sinophone equivalent to the Grammy Awards). 
The songs on Sisters such as "You Don't Want Anything (原來你什麼都不要)," "Released (解脫)," "Cut Love (剪愛)" and the titular track enjoyed hefty radio airplay throughout the Sinophone world. On the album's titular track, Chang invited A-Mei's mother, sisters and other relatives to participate in the chorus singing and added Puyuma musical elements to make the song more culturally enriching. The outstanding sales of Sisters helped it become the fourth best-selling album in Taiwan overall. It won the top ten albums of the Chinese Musicians Exchange Association in 1997, and eventually was placed at No. 10 in the selection of the "200 Best Taiwanese Popular Music Albums."
On 17 May 1997, Billboard Magazine declared A-Mei Asia's most popular singer. On 7 June 1997, she released her second studio album titled Bad Boy. For this record Chang was still highly involved in the songwriting and production department. Bad Boy became A-Mei's second consecutive album to top the Taiwan IFPI chart for nine weeks, and sold 1.38 million copies, making it the most sold album in Taiwanese music history.  Additionally it sold an excess of six million copies throughout Asia, making A-Mei one of the most powerful and sought-after celebrities in the continent. The album Bad Boy spawned numerous hit singles such as the title track, "Can't Cry (哭不出來)," "Whenever I Think About You (一想到你呀)," "Dancing Alone (一個人跳舞)" and "Listen to the Sea (聽海)." They all have now been regarded as modern-day classics and are still receiving heavy rotation and being sung by contestants on televised major music competitions to this day. A-Mei performed songs from the album on her A-Mei Live In Concert 1998 concert tour the following year. Bad Boy earned her two Golden Melody Award nominations for Album of the Year and Best Mandarin Female Singer. However, tragedy struck five months after the album's release; her manager Chang died on 12 November 1997, at age 31, after falling into a coma for 24 days due to a car crash that occurred on 20 October 1997. During Chang's stay in the hospital, A-Mei visited him many times. At that time, to pay tribute to Chang who was dying, she released the CD single "Listen to You, Listen to Me (聽你聽我)." On 29 December 1997, she released the innovative album You Make Me Free Make Me Fly!, which featured the songs that were to be performed on her upcoming tour. The album was another hit, shipping 800,000 units in Taiwan and four million throughout Asia.


=== 1998–1999: Holding Hands, Can I Hug You, Lover? and A-Mei New Century Collection ===
A-Mei embarked on her first solo concert tour which was in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, in January 1998. On 10 January 1998, A-Mei held her first large-scale ticketed concert titled A-Mei Live in Concert 1998, breaking the record for the shortest time a large-scale concert has been held by a Taiwanese singer since their debut (there was only a year and 28 days between the release date of the first album and the date of the concert). It also became the fastest-selling concert in Taiwan in the past decade and had a very fanatic audience, with both the Taipei and Kaohsiung shows being full houses. The two shows at the Singapore Indoor Stadium also set a number of records, including the record for the fastest sold-out concert: the first show was sold out within ten hours while the second was sold out within eight hours.
Due to her immense fame, A-Mei was formally invited by the Japanese public broadcaster NHK to perform as a representative of Taiwan in the annual ceremony "Asia Live Dream" in February 1998. 12 October 1998, saw the release of her fourth studio album, Holding Hands. In the album, A-Mei sang the posthumous works "Are You Ready" and "Her Consciousness (後知後覺)" of her mentor Chang Yu-sheng and for the first time collaborated with Taiwanese singer-songwriter David Tao, who had just risen in the music scene. He wrote and composed the songs "Don't Lie To Me (不要騙我)" and "High High High." Continuing her winning streak of success, the album earned a RIT record certification by selling over 790,000 copies in the span of one month. Cumulative sales reached 1.1 million copies in Taiwan and four million in Asia. Holding Hands earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer. Also in 1998, she won the Best Theme Song award at the Star Awards 1998 ceremony for her performance of the song "I Do Not Mind (我無所謂)," which served as the opening theme song to the TV series Rising Expectations. On December 31, a New Year's Eve concert titled "Sisters Acting, Singing and Partying Through 1999" was held at Nangang in Taipei.
In January 1999, A-Mei endorsed Sprite in Sinophone territories, singing the song "Give Me Feelings (給我感覺)" in the commercials. The commercial was filmed in Shanghai, which resulted in serious traffic jams around the shooting site. At this point she had won more than 30 awards in just two and a half years since her debut, and her total album sales exceeded ten million. In the past two years, she had been awarded consecutively. In the preceding year alone MTV selected her record as the best Mandarin album. A-Mei won the "Gold Award for Female Singer in the Music World" in the 1998 Ultimate Song Chart Awards Ceremony held by Commercial Radio Hong Kong and the "Asia Pacific Music Award" in the 1998 Top Ten Golden Songs Awards Ceremony. Winning "District's Most Popular Hong Kong Female Singer," she had become the only non-Hong Kong native and non-Hong Kong debut singer to win those two awards. On 20 April 1999, her EP entitled Feel was released and sold 180,000 copies, making it the best-selling mini-album in Taiwan's music history. On 8 June 1999, A-Mei released her fifth album Can I Hug You, Lover?. Carrying the momentum of the upcoming Mei Li 99 concert, the album sold more than 500,000 copies within its first week of availability in Taiwan, and was No. 1 on the IFPI chart for an eleven consecutive weeks, breaking the nine week championship record of her very own album Bad Boy. It sold a total of 1.18 million copies in Taiwan, and finally more than eight million copies in Asia, breaking the Asian sales record of six million copies of the highest-selling album in Taiwan, Bad Boy, to become A-Mei's highest-selling album in Asia to date. The album also earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer.
In the following months A-Mei held her second Asia concert Tour, Mei Li 99, visiting various cities in Taiwan and other Asian cities, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing and Shanghai. She became the first Taiwanese singer to perform at the Shanghai Stadium, with the seats at the venue filled to the brim; it is notable that there were nearly 80,000 attendees attending the show, making it the most successful concert in that city's history. On 6 August 1999, she became the first artist to perform a concert at Beijing's Workers' Stadium. With more than 60,000 tickets sold, she broke the record for the highest number of spectators for a single performance in the city. More than 50,000 people poured into the two concerts at Hong Kong's now defunct Kai Tak Airport, making her the first and last Taiwanese singer to hold two ticketed concerts there. At the Taipei Municipal Stadium, she became the only female singer to "open the entire venue" to a crowd of nearly 50,000 people, thus being regarded as a major benchmark in Taiwan's concert history. A-Mei is also the first to perform in Taitung County by holding a large-scale ticketed concert at the Taitung County Stadium that attracted tens of thousands of people. In Singapore, she also became the first act to perform at the Singapore National Stadium; all the 35,000 tickets at that concert sold out completely. The tour held 14-concerts and attracted about 500,000 spectators, all told.

At this point in time Eastern and even Wester papers had dubbed her popularity the "A-Mei syndrome." In the same year, A-Mei became the first Taiwanese artist to appear on the cover of Asia Weekly. Many people at the time even believed that she had the ability to inherit Teresa Teng's popularity in mainland China. In September 1999, she sang "Love, Never Disappears (愛, 永遠不會消失)," a song composed by Wang Leehom, to honor the victims of the 921 earthquake (also known as Chi-Chi earthquake) and donated her concert revenue from that night in Singapore to charity. In December 1999, she performed with Jacky Cheung at the 36th Golden Horse Awards. A-Mei's so-called "sister power" became unstoppable at that point, and she was listed among the "Top Ten Chinese Voice Figures" in 1999 by Huasheng Magazine. On 28 December 1999, A-Mei released the greatest hits album A-Mei New Century Collection. It also became a hot seller, shipping 410,000 copies in Taiwan and 3 million copies in Asia. It is Taiwan's best-selling album by a female artist in the 21st century. On 31 December 1999, she participated in two New Year's Eve concerts in Taipei City.


=== 2000: China Ban and Regardless ===
Initially, the year 2000 began without a hitch. In January 2000, A-Mei performed Sprite's new Chinese commercial song, "I Want to Fly (我要飛)." During that same month, the latest issue of the now defunct American magazine Details produced the Millennium "International Ecstasy List." Taiwan's Shu Qi and A-Mei were both on the list, with Details going as far as calling her China's Madonna. On February 4, 2000, she was invited to CCTV Spring Festival Gala 2000, where she sung the song "Give Me Feelings (给我感觉)," which is a treatment that many famous singers have never had the chance to enjoy. After the Spring Festival Gala A-Mei's popularity continued to skyrocket in mainland China. On 28 February 2000, she became the first Taiwanese artist to be interviewed by the American cable television network CNN. CNN called A-Mei the "Asian Music Ambassador" and praised her for taking the mainland by storm with her singing at a time when cross-strait relations were tense and everchanging. In March 2000, she held two shows in Hong Kong with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra; singing a wide variety of songs that included Chinese, English, Cantonese and Taiwanese Hokkien classics at the Hong Kong Coliseum. A month later on 14 April 2000, she released the audio of the performances on a live album titled Time to Say Goodbye, A-Mei Hong Kong Live.
On 20 May 2000 she sang the National Anthem of the Republic of China at the presidential inauguration ceremony of Chen Shui-bian, angering the government of the People's Republic of China which subsequently interfered her with visiting mainland China until July 2001. Under pressure from Beijing, Sprite also buckled and cut its contract with A-Mei by removing her as its endorser, meanwhile contemporary hit radio stations in China temporarily ceased broadcasting her music. On 5 December 2000, she released her seventh studio album titled Regardless, which turned out to ultimately be A-Mei's last original studio record to be released under Forward Music. The album was another hit for her by selling over 360,000 copies in Taiwan and over a million copies across Asia. Regardless is listed as one of the best-selling albums in Taiwan in the 21st century. The album earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer at the 12th Golden Melody Awards. To promote the album she held a concert at Nangang District, Taipei on the day of its premiere. A-Mei also held  press conferences in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. On 31 December 2000, she participated in a New Year's Eve concert in Taipei.


=== 2001–2003: Switch to Warner Music, Truth, Fever and Brave ===
A-Mei graced the cover of Newsweek in January 2001, with the headline "Pop & Politics." This made her the only Taiwanese singer to pose on the magazine's cover to date. After finding a home in June 2001 with Warner Music Taiwan, A-Mei sang the Mandarin theme song for the movie Pearl Harbor, which was a cover of Faith Hill's "There You'll Be." In August, Beijing hosted the 2001 Summer Universiade; when she was invited to be a guest at the opening ceremony and sang the two songs "Sisters (姊妹)" and "Holding Hands (牵手)" at the finale, the entire venue of 80,000 people screamed and cheered. On 7 September 2001, Forward Music released the compilation album, Journey, which included all unreleased songs A-Mei recorded when she was signed under Forward Music. The album sold over 100,000 copies in Taiwan and a million copies across Asia. 29 October 2001, saw the release of her first album under Warner, which was simply titled Truth. Commercially, the album was a success, selling over 200,000 copies in Taiwan and 1.6 million copies across Asia. Hit songs like the title track, "Remember (記得)" and "Hate That I Love You (我恨我愛你)" became popular songs in major televised singing talent shows years down the line. On 9 November 2001, in Taipei City, the "Real New Song Concert" was held at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall where A-Mei held a free large-scale concert to promote the album. More than 30,000 fans were packed at the venue, allowing fans who had not seen each other for a long time to share her musical works over the past year. In December 2001, A-Mei held seven concerts in the United States and Canada. The Toronto show is also the most successful solo concert held by a Taiwanese singer there in recent years. At the last performance of the tour in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, a small autograph session for a hundred fans was held. During the event the local mayor of Cupertino presented the "Outstanding Artist Award from Cross-Strait and Three Places." On 31 December 2001, she participated in a New Year's Eve concert in Taipei City.
In 2002 A-Mei won the Best Mandarin Female Singer award for the very first time with the album Truth at the 13th Golden Melody Awards; it was a deserving win after four years of consecutive nominations in the same category since her second album Bad Boy. Also a performing guest, she put on a showcase titled, "Best of Asia" that evening. A-Mei was named as one of the 25 Asian Heroes featured in the special issue of Time Magazine in 2002. On 30 August 2002, she released her tenth studio album Fever. The first batch of 120,000 copies was sold out within five days of its release, and the demand for goods continued to soar past the 150,000 mark. The album sold 180,000 copies in Taiwan and over two million copies throughout Asia, making it yet another success. Fever earned her two Golden Melody Award nominations for Album of the Year and Best Mandarin Female Singer. On 3 August 2002, she embarked on her third concert tour, A-Class Entertainment World Tour, which visited Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and United States. In the same year, she won the MTV Asia Award for Favorite Artist Taiwan. A-Mei appeared on the cover of Asia Weekly for the second time at the end of the year. The magazine titled "A-Mei Sings the Future of Cross-Strait, Singing Through the Political Wall of the Taiwan Strait," using her singing to penetrate the ideologies of both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and sung out new hope for the future of the Taiwan Strait. In Star News' poll of young Taiwanese people's favorite female idols, according to the newspaper's questionnaire survey results, A-Mei won the title of teenagers' favorite female idol with 5.8%. Beating out other popular figures like Stefanie Sun, Coco Lee and Elva Hsiao.
Due to the SARS epidemic in 2003 A-Mei enthusiastically participated in the charity record co-sponsored by Wang Leehom, David Tao and Azio TV. The song was titled "Hand in Hand" and featured other prolific musicians like Jay Chou, Elva Hsiao, Jolin Tsai, S.H.E and Jody Chiang. In June 2003, A-Mei sponsored the Korean PC game "A3," being paid tens of millions for the endorsement. On the 27th of the same month, the album Brave was released. She also had her first starring role in a film serving as the heroine of the movie Brave, and sang the theme song "Brave" for the movie of the same name. The song "Brave" became the champion song in the gay love song vote that year. Brave is the only A-Mei album to date to not receive a nomination for a Golden Melody, but it still achieved great sales of 170,000 copies in Taiwan and 1.6 million in Asia. The commercial success of Brave convinced the record company to spend tens of millions holding three "It's Me Who's Missing You" summer concerts in Taitung's Seaside Park, Sizihwan and Fulong Beach. In the second half of 2003 the A-Class Entertainment World Tour was held in Malaysia, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Connecticut, Las Vegas and other places. In November 2003, she participated in the "City of Joy – Chang Yu-Sheng, All Star Tribute Concert" to commemorate her mentor the late Chang Yu-sheng.


=== 2004–2005: Maybe Tomorrow, decline in sales and popularity, and studying abroad at Boston ===
At the MTV Asia Awards 2004 A-Mei won the award for Favorite Artist Taiwan for the second time on Valentine's Day 2004. At the end of April 2004, A-Mei won a World Peace Music Award in recognition of her emphasis on indigenous culture and her extraordinary influence in the Sinophone world, making her the first Taiwanese singer to win this award. On 12 June 2004, A-Mei became the focus of international controversy when she was forced to abruptly cancel a concert in Hangzhou after students from Zhejiang University branded her a "supporter of Taiwanese independence." Several hundred students invaded a press conference at which she had been scheduled to appear, chanting slogans and holding banners decrying the "green performer." Concerned for A-Mei's safety, the organizers canceled her appearance. Back home in Taiwan, A-Mei was under fire from individuals who championed Taiwanese pride. China's state-run CCTV had quoted her as saying, apparently about her decision to sing her national anthem at President Chen's inauguration in Taiwan: "I had to suffer the consequences of a decision that was not made by me ... I should have been more discreet in my behavior, which impacts so many people." The former Vice President Annette Lu even questioned the patriotism of the popster. Meanwhile, Premier Yu Shyi-kun offered a clarification of his own previous remarks about the singer. He explained that his remarks were intended to criticize China, and that he had not intended to criticize the singer herself, arguing that the local media had misquoted him. While politics and showbiz are not exactly bedfellows in Asia, A-Mei clarified that she has no intention of engaging in anything irrelevant to her profession. In response to the uproar, A-Mei called on the media to cease its sensational reporting and to end their distortion of her words. She reinforced her position by stating, "What we really need is more peace and love in our country." Political issues aside, A-Mei gave a benefit concert in Taipei on 22 July 2004, for the victims of Typhoon Mindulle, which caused widespread destruction that summer, especially in the aboriginal areas in the country. The concert was free, but each audience member was asked to make a donation of US$30. On 31 July 2004, A-Mei set foot in Beijing once again and held a successful concert, with an estimated 10,000-strong audience. As reported by the media, A-Mei confessed that she had never felt such great pressure at a concert before, when fans begged her not to be disturbed by the raucous protesters.
Undeterred by negativity, A-Mei proceeded to work on her new album Maybe Tomorrow, which was released on 21 September 2004. A-Mei composed the two songs "Love Is The Only Way (愛是唯一)" and "Crucial Moment (關鍵時刻)" on the album. The album earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer at the 16th Golden Melody Awards. The music video of the song, "Love Is The Only Way" was nominated for Best Music Video of the Year. In October, it was featured in American LGBT magazine The Advocate. While Maybe Tomorrow performed well at first, it quickly fell off the charts due to its sound, which was different from the standard Mandarin pop sound at that time. A-Mei also stirred up controversy with the song "Love Is The Only Way," which had a music video that depicted a same-sex wedding with the two grooms sharing a kiss. The video ended up being banned from broadcasting in the mainland. As a whole the album sold about 80,000 units in Taiwan, which is considerably lower than her previous releases. Maybe Tomorrow became A-Mei's lowest-selling studio album to that point and was generally viewed as an abject commercial failure. The many personal and professional setbacks over the past year made A-Mei contemplate on whether her current situation was suitable for continuing her music career; so at the end of 2004 she came up with the idea of temporarily leaving the music scene to go study abroad in Boston, Massachusetts. In the same year, A-Mei became the only Chinese singer to be featured on the cover of the UK's NME, with her album Maybe Tomorrow trumping Oasis' Don't Believe the Truth, Coldplay's X&Y, and the rest of the powerhouses to be crowned the 'Best British Album of the New Century', and to be featured on the cover.
In January 2005 she went to Hong Kong to participate in a charity show that was meant to raise funds for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In February 2005, she headed to Boston for a three-month language study through Boston University's Center for English Language & Orientation Programs. The trip to Boston was intended as a journey of self-discovery rather than a mere getaway. After returning to Taiwan she first participated in Ni Min-jan's public memorial and sang to comfort his family. Meanwhile, a series produced by the Discovery Channel in collaboration with Taiwan's Government Information Office called "Portraits Taiwan (台灣人物誌)" that spotlighted Taiwanese icons in different fields, selected A-Mei as the representative of the "Mass Culture and Entertainment" category. A-Mei took up the task as the Taiwanese World Vision International ambassador and headed to southern Sudan with the charitable organization in June/July 2005. On 2 September 2005, she went to Shanghai to participate in Jackie Chan's racing fundraiser. On 1 October 2005, A-Mei participated in a national women's charity endorsement, which also made her the first singer to sing at the Taipei Arena. In November of the same year, A-Mei performed "Singing Sister Shadow" at the 42nd Golden Horse Awards. Her live singing skills and stage charm were unanimously praised by the public, and the performance was regarded as her first big step to return to the pinnacle of the music scene after a brief slump.


=== 2006–2007: Resurgence of sales, revived popularity, I Want Happiness? and Star ===
On 17 February 2006 she released her thirteenth studio album, I Want Happiness?. Producer Eric Chen used A-Mei's most pure and direct singing as the main theme. On the first day of release nearly 100,000 copies of the album were pre-ordered. Popular singles from the album such as the title track and "Hostage (人質)" became popular songs in KTV and major televised singing competitions. Widely considered as her comeback album, I Want Happiness? was a commercial success by selling 160,000 copies in Taiwan, and the record is credited for saving her career from its imminent doom. In the mainland Chinese market, it even won the first half of the year with total sales of 960,000 copies. The album sales champion eventually sold over two million copies in Asia and earned her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Female Mandarin Singer. On 27 May 2006, a ticketed concert was held in Las Vegas, with all of the 7,000 tickets sold out entirely. The organizers also specially arranged for A-Mei to take a helicopter to the press conference venue to enjoy diva-level treatment. In June 2006, A-Mei participated in the finale performance titled "Music ORZ" at the 17th Golden Melody Awards. In December 2006, she produced a musical, In Love with Carmen, which was performed twice at Taipei Arena. During the performances she invited the Singaporean singer A-do and the Taiwanese singer A-Lin (who had just debuted at the time) to join her on stage.
In April 2007, EMI Taiwan spent more than ten million to hold a pan-Asian press conference in Hong Kong that was meant to announce the signing of A-Mei to their company. During the event she signed a three-year and three album recording contract worth NT$150 million, making her the highest-paid female singer in the region at the time. On 3 August 2007, she released her fourteenth studio album, Star. The critically and commercially acclaimed effort earned her three Golden Melody Award nominations for Best Mandarin Album, Best Female Mandarin Singer, and Song of the Year for  "A Moment (一眼瞬間)," which was a duet with Taiwanese singer Jam Hsiao. Star occupied the No. 1 spot on Taiwan's G-Music charts for four consecutive weeks and ended up selling over 130,000 copies in Taiwan and 1.7 million copies in Asia. To celebrate the sales of Star a concert was held at Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf on 9 September 2007. 30,000 attended that night, setting a record for the largest number of people attending a concert held by a singer at that venue. On 22 September 2007, she participated in the fourth Asia Song Festival in Seoul, South Korea, with her three-song performance receiving many praises. In the same month A-Mei became the very first Taiwanese singer to be interviewed by the news agency Reuters. In October 2007, she served as the "Rainbow Ambassador" for the fifth annual Taiwan Pride parade. She said that she was very happy for the support her gay fans have given her along the way and will always support gays who are in hiding along with the ones who are happy to come forward. She also generously embraced HIV carriers Yahui and Ladybug on stage and expressed her hope to participate in the Pride Parade every year. In November 2007, she embarked on her fourth solo concert tour called the Star World Tour which visited Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Canada and United States.


=== 2008–2010: Turandot and Amit ===

In February 2008, A-Mei filmed the music video for the 2008 Olympics theme song "Forever Friends" in the Forbidden City. From March to May 2008, she embarked on an opera tour of the musical Turandot in Japan, which was produced by Joe Hisaishi and directed by Amon Miyamoto. A-Mei overcame the language barrier and performed in Tokyo with many Japanese actors. She performed 59 consecutive performances overall in major Japanese cities such as Osaka and Nagoya, with all of the performances being very well received. On 12 May 2008, the 2008 Sichuan earthquake occurred. She donated the NT$5 million revenue from 11 performances of Turandot between the 12th to the 22nd to the earthquake victims so that they could rebuild their homes. At the 19th Golden Melody Awards that year, not only was she nominated for five awards and invited to perform for her Star album, A-Mei brought her "Amit" performance style to the big stage for the first time with pop punk music.
At the end of March 2009, the Star World Tour ended at the Taipei Arena. The tour lasted a year and five months and held 20 performances in 13 cities, attracting an audience of 500,000 spectators. A-Mei became the first Chinese singer to perform five consecutive concerts with the same theme at the Taipei Arena. She released her fifteenth studio album, Amit, on 26 June 2009, which was her very first album to be released under her aboriginal birth name. This album showed a significant change in the genre of music A-Mei sung, as most of the songs incorporated hard rock music. The songs in the album extensively touch on serious topics such as personality conflicts, lost family ties, human sexuality, female consciousness, homosexuality, among others. The commercially successful album sold over 120,000 copies in Taiwan and topped the G-Music charts for three nonconsecutive weeks, while sales across Asia exceeded 1.3 million. On 5 September 2009, she became the spokesperson for the 2009 Summer Deaflympics held in Taipei and participated in the opening ceremony as a guest, singing the theme song "Dreams You Can Hear (聽得見的夢想)." In November 2009, she embarked on her fifth concert tour, Amit First Tour, which visited Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia. In March 2010, she was paid nearly ten million yuan to become the spokesperson of Coca-Cola in Taiwan. At the 21st Golden Melody Awards, A-Mei became the most decorated artist that night with the album Amit winning a total of six trophies. The last time A-Mei had received a major Golden Melody Award was when she won the Golden Melody Award for Best Female Mandarin Singer in 2002 for her album Truth eight years prior.


=== 2011–2013: R U Watching Me? and AMeiZING World Tour ===

In January 2011, The Biography Channel (now known as FYI), which mainly reports on the world's most influential and representative figures, produced a special episode about A-Mei, which was broadcast in 23 countries around the world with more than 67 million viewers. The exclusive interview focuses on A-Mei's story from when she went to study in the United States in 2005 when her career had circled the drain, to when she later produced a musical and became a sensation in the music industry as Amit. She is the first Taiwanese singer to accept this interview. In March 2011, she renewed her contract with Coca-Cola Company to become the spokesperson for their 125th anniversary; A-Mei was also allowed to personally design a limited edition commemorative bottle. On 23 April 2011, the album R U Watching Me?, which took three years to produce, was released.

In December of the same year, A-Mei held a free outdoor concert to support the legalization of same-sex marriage at Huashan 1914 Creative Park. The concert had no sponsorships, so the production cost of more than three million was paid all by herself.


=== 2014–2019: EMI / Universal Music, Faces of Paranoia, Amit 2 and Story Thief ===
In January 2014 A-Mei was placed on the Asia Gay Equality Heroes list made by the well-known international gay magazine Element Magazine in Singapore.

=== A-Mei New Century Collection ===
A-Mei New Century Collection is the first greatest hits album by Taiwanese singer A-Mei. It was released on December 28, 1999, by Forward Music. The album contains Sprite's 2000 advertising song "I Want to Fly," along with the charity single "Love, Never Disappears," which was specially composed by Leehom Wang for the 1999 Jiji earthquake victims. In addition, the album also includes A-Mei's past best-selling hit singles from her previous studio albums that were released between 1996 and 1999. Commercially, A-Mei New Century Collection was a huge success in Greater China, selling over 410,000 copies in Taiwan, while also selling over 3 million copies throughout Asia. It is also Taiwan's best-selling album by a female artist in the 21st century, along with being the third best-selling album in Taiwan of the year 2000.


== Background and release ==
In March 1996, A-Mei signed a recording contract with Forward Music, through which she later released five studio albums—Sisters (1996), Bad Boy (1997), You Make Me Free Make Me Fly!

=== A-Minima ===
The A-Minima is a Super 16 movie camera that was introduced by Aaton in 1999. Touted as the smallest reflex viewfinder movie camera at the time, the camera is distinguished by its low-profile form-factor. It has a size comparable to a small prosumer video camera, and weights 4.4 pounds (2.0 kg) including film and battery. The A-Minima was the first Super 16 only camera.
In order to accommodate the camera design, Aaton worked with Eastman Kodak to create a specially designed flexible flange 200 feet (61 m) daylight spool. Because of the spool's particular design and the fact that the camera requires A-wind 16 mm film, the A-Minima can only use Kodak film stock, manufactured specifically for use with the A-Minima. The 200 foot length (approximately 5.5 minutes at 24 frame/s) and slightly noisy sound rating of 29 dB make it convenient as a B-camera or second unit camera; however, the small size and ease of use, along with an integrated AatonCode timecode unit, allow for less conspicuous and cumbersome shooting on Super 16. The camera is aimed at documentary filmmakers.

=== A-Next ===
A-Next is a team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is the Marvel Comics 2 universe version of the Avengers. The team made its first appearance in What If? #105, the first comic featuring Spider-Girl, and the team's origin story was told in A-Next #1 (Oct. 1998).


== Publication history ==
The first issue of A-Next paid homage to The Avengers #1, with an Asgardian menace prompting new superheroes to band together, all of them analogues to the original team. Future stories introduced new heroes and villains, most of them based on pre-existing Marvel characters. Characters and story elements created by DeFalco in the comic were used in other comics in the MC2 Universe.
A five issue miniseries entitled Avengers Next ran from November 2006 to January 2007, written by Tom DeFalco and with artwork by Ron Lim, that followed on from the events of Last Hero Standing and Last Planet Standing. It reunited the remaining members of A-Next and added new members to the team, namely Sabreclaw, Kate Power (of Power Pack), Thena, the daughter of Thor, and a former criminal teleporter called Warp.


== Fictional team biography ==

The new team comes together when Avengers Museum (formerly Avengers Mansion) is attacked by Asgardian trolls commanded by Loki, prompting the museum's caretaker and former butler Edwin Jarvis to send out a distress signal.
The summons is responded to by several heroes including Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson, son of the original Thunderstrike, who was visiting the mansion at the time of the attack); Stinger (Scott Lang's daughter Cassie Lang, now an entomologist, who was testing Ant-Man's old uniform); Mainframe (a mysterious armored individual); J2 (Zane Yama, high school student and teenage son of the Juggernaut) and the adult Speedball, Jubilee and Jolt.
The heroes are transported to Asgard by Loki, who wants to retrieve the Thunderstrike mace's powers for himself, but Kevin disrupts the spell, absorbing the mace into himself and transforming into a new Thunderstrike in the process. Loki and the trolls are then defeated by the heroes, with assistance from Thor, now the King of Asgard. Thunderstrike, Stinger, J2, and Mainframe decide to stay together as the new Avengers. The adult heroes decline to stay with the reformed team.
A downed Kree spaceship leads to the transformation of Bill Foster's son John into Earth Sentry, an analog of Captain Marvel. Doc Magus, the new Sorcerer Supreme, then recruits the Avengers into fighting the reformed Defenders.
Four new members are then inducted into the Avengers by Mainframe and Jarvis. The new members: American Dream, (a female analogue of Captain America); Freebooter (who modeled himself on Hawkeye and the Swordsman); Crimson Curse (an analogue to the Scarlet Witch) and Bluestreak (an analogue to Quicksilver); known collectively as the Dream Team, save N'kano, the Wakandan ambassador, from the racist Soldiers of the Serpent (an amalgam of the Sons of the Serpent and elements from the Egyptian god Set), with the assistance of the Coal Tiger, the son of the Black Panther.
Afterwards, the team investigates the apparent return of Doctor Doom, who is revealed to be Kristoff Vernard in disguise. The team is then attacked by Argo, who claims to be Hercules' son, followed by an encounter with the villainous Ion Man, prompting Mainframe to reveal he is a sentient computer program based on Tony Stark's personality.
The new Avengers discover the Scarlet Witch in suspended animation in the mansion's subterranean levels, powering a gate to an alternate Earth. After defeating the Soldiers of the Serpent again, with the help of Blacklight (the daughter of Monica Rambeau), the Avengers travel to the alternate dimension, which had been conquered by Red Skull after World War II, and was now ruled by the Skull's adopted son, Dr. Doom, who had murdered the Skull. During the battle, they discover Captain America is alive and leading the resistance, and the Avengers help them defeat the Nazi forces, including the Thunder Guard, an alternate version of the Avengers.
Thunderstrike elects to stay on the alternate Earth, and the remaining Avengers return to Earth, receiving a reprimand from Tony Stark and Clint Barton. Immediately afterwards, they're attacked by a team of villains known as the Revengers, led by Red Queen and Big Man, the children of Hank and Janet Pym, out for revenge. The Avengers, alongside their reserve members Earth Sentry, Coal Tiger, Argo and Blacklight, defeat the Revengers.
The team was occasionally seen aiding Spider-Girl, and also appeared during Last Hero Standing and Last Planet Standing. The team also made a cameo within Fantastic Five vol. 2 #4, in which they were fighting one of the cosmic-powered Doombots.


== Team members ==


=== Founding members ===


==== J2 ====
The only minor in the team, J2 is Zane Yama, a 15-year-old high school student and the son of the original Juggernaut (Cain Marko) and district attorney Sachi Yama. Picked on by bullies at school, he manifested the ability to grow to a huge size, in which he gains super strength and invulnerability. His uniform, which includes his father's favorite flannel shirt tied around his waist over his armor, manifests itself automatically upon metamorphosis. He can only stay this way for about an hour.


==== Mainframe ====
Mainframe is a self-aware computer program, created by Tony Stark, which inhabits a series of identical armors. When an armor is damaged or destroyed, he simply transfers his consciousness to another body. His robot body utilizes Stark technology similar to the one found in the Iron Man armor. His personality is based on his creator's, possibly created by the same process as the Vision's.


==== Stinger ====
Dr. Cassandra Lang is the daughter of the second Ant-Man, Scott Lang. Although she is the oldest member, in her mid-20s, and the only one on the team with a professional life and a scientific background, she is still doted on by her father, who constantly worries about her new-found superhero life. She possesses many abilities originally engineered by Henry Pym, including resizing, flying, communication with insects and artificial "stingers", all based on her costume and helmet.


==== Thunderstrike ====
18-year-old Kevin Masterson is the son of the original Thunderstrike. He absorbed his father's mace into his body, and has gained the ability to produce "thunderclaps"; bursts of concussive force from his hands. He can use them to simulate super strength or to propel him in huge Hulk-like leaps. Although he doesn't possess real super strength, he has limited invulnerability. In his civilian identity, he is a college student.


=== Dream Team ===

The Dream Team is a fictional group of heroes in the Marvel Comics MC2 universe. They first appeared in A-Next #4, and are based upon the "kooky quartet" of replacement Avengers introduced in Avengers #16. In their first appearance, Mainframe accepts them as members of the Avengers without consulting the existing members, which initially creates conflict between the original A-Next team and the Dream Team.
The team roster comprises:


==== American Dream ====
Shannon Carter is the niece of Sharon Carter. Her uniform design is based on Captain America's and includes a set of stun discs (similar to Nomad's) that can be thrown at opponents. She does not possess any powers, but is an Olympic-level athlete, a skilled fighter and a strategist. American Dream was later rewarded the shield of an alternate-reality Captain America after saving that world from destruction.


==== Bluestreak ====
Blue Kelso is impatient and straightforward. Her main power is superspeed. She was once affiliated with the X-People (successors to the X-Men), until she joined the Avengers when she realized she would not get much publicity.
Brash, cocky, and uninhibited, the self-proclaimed "sexiest speedster" has short blue hair with a silver forelock, a blue lightning tattoo around her right bicep, and wears blue lipstick. Her uniform consists of a silver arm- and leg-baring bodysuit with a blue lightning bolt from her left shoulder to her right hip. Silver high tops, silver gloves, and snazzy blue shades complete the effect.


==== Crimson Curse ====
Aerika Harkness is related to the witch Agatha Harkness, former teacher to the Scarlet Witch. She possesses control over magical energies, although the exact nature of those energies is not known. They appear similar to the way the Scarlet Witch's powers were originally portrayed, and she can control it with relative ease. She died stopping an alternate Doctor Doom from attempting to use the Cosmic Cube to invade the Avengers' Earth.


==== Freebooter ====
Brandon Cross was trained by Hawkeye and Swordsman and has shown proficiency with a variety of weapons as well as athletic skills. His costume design draws from both Hawkeye and the Swordsman. Freebooter was romantically linked to Crimson Curse.


=== Other recruits ===


==== Kate Power ====
Kate Power, originally known as Energizer, is the youngest member of Power Pack, a team of pre-teen superheroes formed by her and her three siblings after gaining their powers from a Kymellian named Aelfyre Whitemane. Her abilities involve disintegrating matter, absorbing its energy and unleashing it as powerballs. Kate joined the Avengers after Franklin Richards recommended Kate to them in their search for Thunderstrike.


==== Sabreclaw ====
Hudson Logan is the son of Wolverine and half-brother to Wild Thing. He possesses claws and a healing factor similar to Wolverine's. He was once a member of the Revengers, but joined the Avengers when he claimed to have reformed.


==== Thena ====
Thena is the daughter of Thor. She was sent to Earth by Thor to search for Kevin Masterson and restore his powers. Initially, she showed great dislike for J2, especially after she realized her abilities had no effect on him, and broke her hammer on his helmet. After J2 saved her from Sylene's cauldron, she was more amicable with him, even giving him a kiss.


==== Warp ====
Warp is a thief with the power to teleport. He originally worked for Sylene (the daughter of Loki) and Ulik. When he learned that they planned to turn Earth into a new version of Asgard, he defected to the Avengers.


=== Reserve members ===


==== Argo the Almighty ====
Argo is the son of former Avenger Hercules. Argo is trying to find his missing father and, needing help, turns to A-Next. Using their S.H.I.E.L.D. contacts, the team is able to locate Hercules, who is suffering from mental trauma from witnessing an event which nearly destroyed the Avengers. Argo attacks his father, enraged that his father "abandoned" his mother and his son, but Thunderstrike intervenes. When Argo sees the emotional state his father is in, the two reconcile. Argo states that he was going to help his father recover, and try to bring his family back together. Later, when A-Next is attacked by the Revengers, Argo fights for his friends (along with other allies of A-Next) and when they won the battle, Argo accepts membership in A-Next.


==== Blacklight ====
Kandra Freeman is the daughter of Photon and Derek Freeman. Blacklight has the ability to manipulate solid light constructs, and use it to fire blasts of destructive energy. She can also focus her energies into solid form and create energy-constructs out of dark force in virtually any form she can envision (ramps, stop signs, giant shovels, etc.). She can also use her energy powers to fly at high speed.


==== Coal Tiger ====
Coal Tiger is the son of Black Panther - named after his grandfather - and the prince of Wakanda. He is able to transform into a humanoid cat-like being. In this feline form, he has superhuman strength and agility, enhanced senses and retractable razor-sharp claws on his fingers and toes.
The character has received accolades from critics.

In 2020, CBR.com ranked Coal Tiger 2nd in their "10 Most Powerful Alternate Versions Of Black Panther" list.
In 2022, Screen Rant included Coal Tiger in their "15 Most Powerful Variants Of Black Panther In Marvel Comics" list.


==== Earth Sentry ====
John Foster is the son of Bill Foster. When John and his father Bill were investigating a UFO crash site, they discovered a Kree space probe. When they neared the ship, the automated defenses activated, and a robotic sentry was released. Bill activated a distress signal which was picked up by Mainframe and the rest of A-Next.


==== Spider-Girl ====
Spider-Girl is May "Mayday" Parker, the daughter of Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson. She possesses the same spider-powers as her father and wears a costume similar to that of her father's clone, the Scarlet Spider, when he briefly wore the mantle of Spider-Man.


== In other media ==
Mainframe appears in Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., voiced by Jeffrey Combs. This version is a gaming A.I. created by Iron Man that gained sentience. In the episode "Wheels of Fury", he threatened to destroy a city if Iron Man lost his real-life game, which Mainframe merely saw as continuing Iron Man's challenge as ordered. In response, the agents of S.M.A.S.H. went up against Mainframe's robots in a roller derby. After the agents of S.M.A.S.H. and Iron Man defeat Mainframe's robots, Mainframe is persuaded not to attack the city. Desiring to learn more about the real world, Mainframe creates a new body and leaves to see the world. In the episode "Planet Monster" Pt. 2, Mainframe is among several heroes who help the agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the Avengers fight the Supreme Intelligence's forces.

=== A-One (graffiti artist) ===
Anthony Clark (1964 – November 11, 2001), known as A-One, was an American graffiti artist. He developed a style he called "aerosol expressionism".


== Life and career ==
A-One was born in Manhattan in 1964 and grew up in the Mitchel Houses in the South Bronx. He was the son of Janette Gordon Clark and the grandson of Mannie Clark Sr., head caddy at the Mayfair Golf Course in Sanford, Florida in the late 1950s.
He began painting at the age of six, and writing graffiti on subway cars in the mid-1970s. A-One joined Rammellzee's graffiti crew Tag Master Killers, which also consisted of Delta2, Kool Koor, and Toxic.
Each member designed their own style for arming letters based on Rammellzee's theory of Gothic Futurism, which describes graffiti as the weaponization of letters in a battle to reclaim language from a "diseased culture" of social control.
In the early 1980s, they were among the graffiti artists bringing original art and music from the Bronx and Queens to the downtown art scene. In 1982, A-One, Toxic, and Kool Koor participated in the group show Camouflaged Panzerism at Fashion Moda in South Bronx.
A-One was a friend and collaborator of artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. Basquiat became his mentor and taught him how get involved with art galleries. A-One is the subject of Basquiat's paintings Portrait of A-One A.K.A. King (1982), which sold for $11.5 million in 2020, and Anthony Clark (1985).
In 1983, A-One participated in the exhibit Jenny Holzer: Survival Series with A-One, Mike Glier, and Lady Pink at Lisson Gallery in London and the Post-Graffiti exhibit at Sidney Janis Gallery in New York.
In 1984, he participated in the group shows Arte di Frontiera: New York Graffiti in Italy, Classical American Graffiti Writers and High Graffiti Artists at Galerie Thomas in Munich, and Rapid Enamel: The Art of Graffiti at the University of Chicago.
A-One became the youngest artist to participate in the Venice Biennale in 1984. His work was featured in the exhibition Writing the Future: Basquiat and the Hip-Hop Generation at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from October 2020 to July 2021.
A-One also had numerous solo exhibitions: Galeria Salvatore Ala, Milan, Italy in 1983; Piccolo Museum in Lecce, Italy in 1985; and Galerie Quintessens, in Utrecht, the Netherlands in 1990; Galleria Salvatore + Caroline Ala in Milan, Italy in 2010.
For some time, he lived in Verona, Italy. He later moved to Paris, where he continued to work until his death from a brain hemorrhage at the age of 37 on November 11, 2001. He is survived by his older brother Octavius "Ocky" Clark, a 1991 Pan American Games gold medalist.

=== A-Plus (store) ===
APlus (or A-Plus) is an American convenience store chain owned and operated by Energy Transfer Partners, with some stores currently owned by Seven & I Holdings (7-Eleven). APlus is also the convenience store chain used by Sunoco.


== History ==
The chain began life as the convenience store chain for Atlantic Petroleum in 1985, which was spun off from ARCO, Inc. (ARCO itself was formed from the 1966 merger of Atlantic Refining and Richfield Oil.) The first Aplus stores were rebranded ampm locations.
In 1988, Sunoco bought Atlantic, and since Sunoco did not have its own convenience store chain, APlus became Sunoco's chain by default. While Atlantic stations were converted to Sunoco by the mid-1990s, APlus grew, with Sunoco rebranding many company-owned stations in the Northeastern United States with convenience stores into APlus. Sunoco has even converted some garages into convenience stores with the APlus brand.
Sunoco still used the APlus logo from the Atlantic days until 1999, when Sunoco updated its own logo and completely redesigning APlus's logo, giving it a more Sunoco look.
The split between company-owned and franchised locations is about 50/50.
Originally a U.S. Northeast brand, Sunoco has rapidly expanded the APlus moniker. In 2001, Sunoco expanded APlus into the Southeastern United States by purchasing 193 of Marathon Oil's Speedway SuperAmerica convenience stores—115 in Florida, 62 in South Carolina, 13 in North Carolina, and 3 in Georgia. Further expansion is being pushed as part of Sunoco's NASCAR sponsorship, where APlus is known as the "Official Pit Stop of NASCAR".
In October 2013, Sunoco purchased Mid-Atlantic Convenience Stores, a Richmond, Virginia based Circle K Franchisee, with over 300 stores in the mid-atlantic region. These locations continued to operate as Circle K until early 2016, when they were converted to the APlus brand. Though operated by Sunoco, the majority of the locations continue to sell Exxon fuels.
On January 23, 2018, Dallas, Texas-based 7-Eleven bought 1,030 APlus convenience stores located in 17 states; the deal also included sister chain Stripes Convenience Stores. The acquisition, which is the largest in the company's history (since surpassed by 7-Eleven's 2021 acquisition of Speedway from Marathon Petroleum), brings the total number of stores to approximately 9,700 in the U.S. and Canada. Many APlus stores are expected to be rebranded to 7-Eleven stores.
As of 2021, 7-Eleven is still in the process of rebranding the acquired locations. However, Sunoco still owns or franchises roughly 350 convenience store locations (many of which are branded as A-Plus).


== Products ==
The list of products offered at APlus locations:

Gulliver's Coffee — APlus's gourmet coffee. Competes with Circle K's Millstone coffee and Sheetz's Sheetz Bros. Coffee.
City Deli — APlus's hot foods area. Likely conceived to compete with Sheetz's MTO's, which overlap APlus in several areas in Pennsylvania, though it is more similar to Giant Eagle's GetGo Kitchen at their GetGo chain. Currently available only at newer, larger locations.

=== A-Punk ===
"A-Punk" is a song by indie rock band Vampire Weekend, released on February 28, 2008, as the second single from their 2008 self-titled debut album. The band made their network television debut by performing "A-Punk" on the Late Show with David Letterman.


== Critical reception ==
Mark Richardson of Pitchfork described "A-Punk" as having a "spunky drive, pogo-inducing rhythm, and subtle but hugely effective sonic accents" and said that "while solid, [it] isn't one of the stronger songs on Vampire Weekend". Drowned in Sound writer Alex Denney, commented that "A-Punk" was not the best song from their debut album due to it being "a little too uptempo to let their disarmingly clever melodies breathe", but stated "for the flute-aping synths and bottled-sunshine guitars alone you need this in your life." The review from Greg Rose of Gigwise, was mixed. Rose said that although the song lacked originality, it "manages to sound unique" due to the lyrical inventiveness of lines by Ezra Koenig such as, "His honor drove southward seeking exotica/cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas", which were described as being "perky" and gave the song "a buzzing zip." In reference to "A-Punk", The Times writer Ben Blackmore, said, "Do believe the hype."
"A-Punk" is widely regarded as one of the band's best songs. Paste and Far Out ranked the song number five and number one, respectively, on their lists of the greatest Vampire Weekend songs. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 62 on its list "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years".


== Commercial performance ==
The song peaked at number 55 on the UK Singles Chart and number 25 on Billboard magazine's Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single also reached #6 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and #36 on their Canada Rock chart. Though it never reached the Billboard Hot 100, the single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 2013, making it the band's first gold single.
On October 27, 2008, Vampire Weekend re-released "A-Punk" in the UK, in the hope of achieving a higher Chart placement on the UK Singles Chart. However, "A-Punk" only managed to peak at number 63, which was less than the placement at number 55 earlier that year.
The single continues to be sold over the years. In 2019, it was certified Platinum in the US and in the UK. In 2020, it achieved platinum certification in Canada.


== Music video ==
The music video directed by Garth Jennings, that was said to convey the song's "spiky energy," used footage of the band performing as sped up stop-motion figures, simulating winter and underwater scenes during the performance. Despite the band being sped up, they "never miss an upstroke beat." The video made its worldwide premiere on January 7, 2008, on MTV2's Subterranean indie video block.

=== A-RAM ===
Advanced-Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) based on single-transistor capacitor-less cells. A-RAM was invented in 2009 at the University of Granada (UGR), in Spain, in collaboration with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), in France. It was conceived by Noel Rodriguez (UGR), Francisco Gamiz (UGR) and Sorin Cristoloveanu (CNRS). A-RAM is compatible with single-gate silicon on insulator (SOI), double-gate, FinFETs and multiple-gate field-effect transistors (MuFETs).
The conventional 1-transistor + 1-capacitor DRAM is extensively used in the semiconductor industry for manufacturing high-density dynamic memories. In 2009, the researchers thought that in manufacturing processes with features smaller than 45 nm, the DRAM industry would need to avoid the miniaturization issue of the memory-cell capacitor. The 1T-DRAM family of memories, including A-RAM, replaced the storage capacitor for the floating body of SOI transistors to store the charge.
The universities obtained at least one patent on the technology, and tried to license it in 2010. The University of Granada ran a web site promoting the technology, updated through 2010. A version called A2RAM was demonstrated in 2012.

=== A-Ronne (Berio) ===
A–Ronne is a composition by the Italian composer Luciano Berio, composed in June 1974 as a tape composition for 5 actors and arranged in 1975 for unaccompanied vocal ensemble (8 singers).
A-Ronne is a setting of a poem by the Italian avant-garde poet Edoardo Sanguineti. Sanguineti's poem is almost entirely built from extracts from and allusions to a wide range of texts, including various translations of The Bible (St. John's Gospel), works by Dante (The Divine Comedy), Goethe (Faust), Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (The Communist Manifesto), T.S. Eliot ("East Coker" from Four Quartets), James Joyce (Finnegans Wake), Samuel Beckett (Endgame), Roland Barthes (an essay on Georges Bataille) and also correspondence between Sanguineti and the composer. The title of the piece is an extension of the term "from A to Z": in the old Italian alphabet the three signs ette, conne, ronne came after z.
Berio employs a wide range of vocalisations, from sung phrases borrowed from Dutch folksongs to direct speech at various pitches and wordless intonations and inflexions. Although Sanguineti's poem is repeated several times throughout, it is usually indiscernible amongst the variety of textures. As such, Berio described the work as a "documentary on a poem by Edoardo Sanguineti, as one would say a documentary on a painting or an exotic country". He also described it as a "theatre of the ear" in the style of late sixteenth-century Italian madrigal singing (madrigale rappresentativo). Also available on BMG (RCA Victrola CD 09026-68302-2).
The work is divided into six untitled sections. It was commissioned by Dutch Radio KRO as a tape composition for five voice actors, three male and two female. It lasts 31:20. The 1975 arrangement was premiered by Swingle II who recorded it for Decca Records in London in 1975.

A-Rosa Cruises is a cruise line based in Rostock, Germany, which operates river cruises in Germany.


== History ==
A-Rosa was established in 2001 as A'Rosa, as a subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises. The company was created to serve the German cruise market, alongside the AIDA Cruises fleet, which had been acquired by P&O in 1999. A'Rosa was modeled loosely on the AIDA concept and began life with three ships. A'Rosa Blu, was the sole cruise ship of the fleet, accompanied by A'Rosa Bella and A'Rosa Donna, two newly built river cruise ships. In 2003, P&O Princess merged with Carnival Corporation to form Carnival Corporation & plc. The A'Rosa brand was sold soon after the merger and was purchased by a private company which owned A-ROSA Flussschiff. The company continues to operate river cruises on the Danube, Main, Mosel, Rhine, Rhône and Saône rivers.

=== A-Sides ===
A-Sides is a compilation album by the American rock band Soundgarden with songs spanning the band's thirteen-year career. It was released on November 4, 1997, through A&M Records.


== Overview ==
Guitarist Kim Thayil said the song list emerged out of list of what each member "thought would make a 'best of' and then we cross-referenced them", adding that while the typical compilation titles 'Best Of' and 'Greatest Hits' was thought by them to a subjective name - "that's something that an individual fan can make of his own collection,and these aren't necessarily our personal favourites" - they went with A-Sides to reflect that these were the A-side singles released on the band's original run. The opening track "Nothing to Say" was originally a B-side to the band's first single "Hunted Down" on Sub Pop in 1987, but Thayil said it took precedence for being their first song to draw a label's attention as part of a compilation titled Bands That Will Make Money. It contains one song absent from previous albums ("Bleed Together") which appeared on import copies of the "Burden in My Hand" single.  In addition, "Get on the Snake" from Louder Than Love was released as a promo-only single in 1989. Also, the 1990 Sub Pop single "Room a Thousand Years Wide" does not appear on A-Sides, nor the 1994 single "My Wave" from Superunknown.
The album was released in 1997 on A&M Records and was Soundgarden's last official release for 13 years, until 2010's Telephantasm. It debuted at number 63 on the Billboard 200 album chart. It peaked at number 51 on the UK Albums Chart, number 39 on the Australian Albums Chart, and number 6 on the New Zealand Albums Chart.
AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars. He said, "For an act that was one of the definitive album artists of the late '80s and '90s, Soundgarden was a surprisingly effective singles band. Their singles effectively conveyed all of their best ideas, from their sludgy early Sub Pop recordings to the elaborate, post-metal psychedelia of their last two albums, Superunknown and Down on the Upside. That's the reason why the 17-track compilation A-Sides is such a successful overview of the band's too-brief career." Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne gave the album an A. He said, "Pruning their best early songwriting ("Hands All Over", "Nothing to Say") and wisely highlighting chunks of their last two (and best) albums, A-Sides presents the band in all its evolving, bridling-horses glory and thunder. When all those Hanson fans grow up and want to educate themselves on the flannel era they missed, here's where they should turn."
Following Chris Cornell's death in May 2017, A-Sides re-entered the Australian albums chart at number 47. On Record Store Day 2018, A-Sides was released on double green translucent vinyl.

=== A-Space ===
The United States Intelligence Community A-Space, or Analytic Space, is a project started in 2007 from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's (ODNI) Office of Analytic Transformation and Technology to develop a common collaborative workspace for all analysts from the USIC.  It is accessible from common workstations and provides unprecedented access to interagency databases, a capability to search classified and unclassified sources simultaneously, web-based messaging, and collaboration tools.  The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is the executive agent for building the first phase of A-Space. Initial operational capability was scheduled for December 2007. A-Space went live on the government's classified Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System 22 September 2008.
A-Space is built on Jive Software's Clearspace application (which has been superseded by Jive's Social Business Software).


== Analytic transformation ==
The Director of National Intelligence has identified A-Space as a critical piece of "Analytic Transformation": "Analytic Transformation seeks to change how we approach analysis, how we interact with our customers and each other, and is one of the principal priorities of the Director of National Intelligence. US Intelligence is engaged in a fundamental transformation of the Analysis mission at the national level."
Within the analytic transformation program, there are several initiatives under way in three areas: 

1) enhancing the quality of analytic products,
2) managing the mission more effectively at a  Community level, and
3) building more integrated analytic operations across the Intelligence Community (IC).

A-Space, according to Andrew McAfee of Harvard Business School, is a means of sharing information that, in the normal course of events, might not be seen at all. He pointed out that "companies that rely heavily on innovation" spend considerable effort improving the communications among close colleagues.  Mark Granovetter's insight, "The Strength of Weak Ties" (SWT) was that strong ties are not enough for the best innovative environments. Strong ties between people arise from long-term, frequent, and sustained interactions; weak ties from infrequent and more casual ones. A tool such as Intellipedia or A-Space encourages collaboration among people with weak ties, complementing the traditional "team-building" and "cross-functional management" characteristic of strong ties.
"How do you transform analysis?" asked Thomas Fingar, deputy director of National Intelligence for Analysis at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). "One word: attitude. For people to collaborate and bring new and vital skills to the intelligence community, we need to change our attitude." Fingar said "60 percent of all U.S. intelligence analysts have five years' experience or less on the job. They expect to collaborate no matter where they are and without concern for chain of command," he said. "There is a sense of urgency, a push from the bottom that didn't exist before." Fingar said intelligence failures proved the need to transform intelligence analysis.
"Analysts have become risk-averse and because of that, many times that attitude precludes good analysis," Fingar said. "We have had more than one major problem every decade since Pearl Harbor. We fail because we are not willing to collaborate or accept the risks of collaboration."


== Security ==
A-Space is open to all 16 elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community.
The first requisite for such a system is that it be secure. To minimize the complexity of the first release, the initial operating capability (IOC) is Web based rather than a full desktop client.  Information Week stated that A-Space must have 16 different security waivers and move across 16 differently configured firewalls. However, all this information in the browser, even on the secure intelligence Intranet, is bound to raise hackles, presumably for the 16 Intelligence Community agencies, according to Mike Wertheimer, assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analytic transformation and technology.
Even though the system will be available only to users with security clearance for TOP SECRET Sensitive compartmented intelligence (SCI), security, in the world of intelligence, is not a simple matter of clearance. Individual users will be authorized, or not authorized to access specific "compartments".  For example, while an analyst might be authorized access to the HUMINT Control System, a major category of SCI, that does not necessarily allow an analyst working on Russia to see data on spies in Somalia. Somalian and Russian information, sometimes down to the granularity of individual spy contributions, are in separate compartments.
Information Week pointed out that at these security levels, the users themselves need to be monitored.  One of the ways A-Space will maintain its security will be through observing traffic patterns, the department doing things like looking out for suspiciously anomalous searches. "Let's not be Pollyanna-ish about this," Wertheimer said. "This is a counter-intelligence nightmare. You've got to ask yourself, if there's one bad apple here, how much can that bad apple learn?"
In many cases, an analyst will have to request access to a new compartment or specific piece of information. It is hoped that this process will be speeded by the web-based services.


== Content ==
To ensure its usefulness, the project will launch with access to the three large databases of current intelligence and Intellipedia. Eventually, A-Space will be capable of carrying documents several levels above Top Secret, certified at a level that 95% of all intelligence can be stored there. Reports will be able to be tagged with important related words or phrases via a system called TagConnect and labeled by usefulness. It will eventually be able to recommend related documents to analysts, much like Amazon recommends related books.


=== The Library of National Intelligence ===
The Library of National Intelligence (LNI) is an ODNI project to create a repository of all Intelligence Community disseminated intelligence, regardless of classification. The Central Intelligence Agency is the executive agent for this project. The Library's electronic card catalog – containing summary information for each report – will be classified at the lowest possible level, permitting analysts to discover everything that has been published by the Intelligence Community (IC) regardless of the original classification of the document. Analysts will be able to request the products in accordance with individual access levels and security guidelines. Services provided by LNI will include the ability to request information directly from producers, qualitative measures of value, and statistics on Community coverage of priorities.
One of the components of the LNI is the CIA WIRe, which went into operation on 7 September 2007. It takes all the agency's intelligence information and makes it available to CIA analysts in one database. According to Gus Hunt, CIA executive agent for LNI, the full LNI became available on 31 October 2007.

"It boggles my mind that it took so long to understand the concept of bringing together all the community knowledge to use effectively," Hunt said. "DNI will let users on the top-secret network share information that was agreed to be released. We now will know [all that] we know about any topic."
Dale Meyerrose, ODNI's chief information officer, said LNI will make all information discoverable [i.e., through weak links], and that is just the starting point. "The pedigree we need to add to data and discovery is huge. It is larger than LNI. The finished product must include intelligence information and open-source information."


=== Social networking ===
In a compartmented environment, analysts may be unaware they have a counterpart, in another IC agency, working on a related problem, and they could assist one another. This is equally true of intelligence consumers; a policymaker might be aware of a CIA report of interest, but not one from the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Indeed, both analysts and consumers may be unaware of the common interests.Social networking will be another critical part of A-Space, where analysts can create trusted contacts with other analysts and post profiles that contain updated contact information and details of their areas of expertise. The analysts' areas of expertise may be further defined through text mining software that sifts through analyst e-mail. The social networking model isn't yet set, but the DNI has invited social networking experts the likes of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and vendors to recommend and help develop specs.
Again, social networking supports interaction through weak links.


=== Similar architectures ===
The Force Protection Assessment system uses a similar architecture to provide knowledge management and real-time updates on operational security analyses.
The need is not only seen at top executive levels. According to Tim Hsia, a United States Army captain, "Market trackers absorb information continuously, rigorously track trends, and enable traders to formulate decisions based on the latest news combined with historical data. The ability of market trackers to store and quickly recall historical data should be mimicked by the U.S. government". Hsia mentioned that the needs for intelligence, by operational military units, are not being met in Iraq and Afghanistan. "Expanding this network to encompass a more centralized program of data sharing would not require any additional hardware. A fusion of geography and intelligence within a centralized network can ensure that commanders arrive at any location with the necessary intelligence derived from years of work by previous agencies and military units that have already provided a framework for understanding the enemy and the people in his assigned area. Commanders could then be spared the countless man hours recollecting data that has already been captured thru blood, sweat, and tears [captured by weakly linked researchers]"

He describes the field need for a database:A geointel, i.e. geospatial intelligence, database should include all agencies of the U.S. government and also extend to coalition partners. ... only cleared individuals and organizations can access certain intelligence products. The end state would be to encompass each city in the world from South America, Asia, and the Middle East. Each city in the geointel database would comprise of an abundance of historical data consisting of analysis, logistical, intelligence products, and operational summaries from all branches of the military, the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), CIA, and National Security Agency. Moreover, the geointel database would incorporate cutting open source intelligence (OSINT) products produced by news agencies, RAND, and other think tanks. By combining products from different branches within the government it would ensure that policy makers from different agencies would have a complete portrait of their region and thus prevent decisions based on data comprised [sic] solely from their agency ...
This fusion of intelligence would not have to be centrally managed and each commander or diplomat could individually assign and weigh different parameters and factors internally within his staff when deciding amongst several courses of action. Intelligence could be pushed down to the lowest level which would then facilitate bottom-up refinement as each new unit that was involved in a certain locale could update the existing data to include their latest experiences. The battlefield commander, diplomat, or United States Army Special Forces SF ODA (Operational Detachment-Alpha) team leader could then make informed military, foreign affairs, or political decisions that produce more effective results because the data retrieved from the geointel site would provide them with the latest ground truth supplemented with historic data.
... The structure of the site should provide ease of accessibility while also compartmentalizing information so that only certain areas can be accessed by individuals depending upon their level of clearance. There would need to be a thorough security vetting process to prohibit individuals from being able to achieve sensitive information outside of their region, scope, and responsibility. ... An additional safeguard would be to have superiors and agencies to proof and screen all intelligence products posted by their subordinates so that faulty and inaccurate reporting could be stunted before other organizations implemented inaccurate information .. .readers could ... view the analyst's oeuvre, credentials, and security levels and also allow the reader to directly contact the author as to their assumptions and inquire about related issues pertaining to an intelligence product.
Hsia points out that while SIPRNET (i.e., operating at the SECRET security level, not the higher intelligence levels) is widely available, "Expanding this network to encompass a more centralized program of data sharing would not require any additional hardware", but software changes in the devices now used to access SIPRNET. Depending on the operational needs, it might be necessary to have additional access points. Typically, only the intelligence staff of a command has access to intelligence data above the SECRET level, just as only the operational staff have access to TOP SECRET mission planning.


== Cost ==
Michael Wertheimer emphasized working with small prototypes at first, which are likely to demonstrate failures. If the prototype is small enough that a new version, which addresses the failure, is not expensive, incremental improvement would be the way to control costs. He mentioned that the initial costs, "well under $5 million", will be for servers, software licenses and design. The greatest design challenge will be achieving the needed security. DNI policy is to have A-Space rely, as much as possible, on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software.
A  service oriented architecture (SOA) was the basic technical mode for building A-space. Eventually, that will allow analysts and developers to write or install their own widgets (i.e., small customized programs) onto their portal page. Widgets might first access Google Maps content, then attach classified layers to a map that could potentially overlay anti-aircraft missile sites with known bunkers. The intelligence community is already blogging, and A-Space could therefore take advantage of RSS feeds for blog content, among other things.
It will be implemented as a portal that includes a Web-based word processing tool akin to GoogleDocs, a wiki-based intelligence community encyclopedia and access to three "huge, terabyte databases" of "raw" (i.e., not yet evaluated) data for analysts to examine. It will be scaled for 10,000 users at day one.

=== A-Square ===
A-Square Company, LLC was a manufacturer of rifles, ammunition and bullets based in Chamberlain, South Dakota, in the United States. The company was one of 19 that are members of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturer's Institution (SAAMI). The company's focus was on its firearms for hunting large dangerous game. This was reflected in the selection of larger caliber chamberings in the company's rifles.


== History ==
The company was established in 1979. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur B. Alphin was the founder and chief designer for the A-Square Company. Besides the company location in Chamberlain, South Dakota, the company had a location in Bedford, Kentucky. By August 2008 Alphin planned to move his ammunition factory to Butte, Montana. 
A-Square-manufactured rifles usually came with stainless steel barrels as a standard feature. The barrels on the rifles use epoxy resin to bed the barrel to the stocks. Magazine boxes were manufactured from plate steel for rigidity and were also welded to the receiver. A-Square rifles were engineered to allow the firing pin to retract further into the bolt body than other firearms (.400 in (10.2 mm)). This increases the force of the firing pin on the cartridge within the chamber.
Available calibers for A-Square firearms range from those designed for large, dangerous game, including the .577 T-Rex and .416 Taylor, through smaller-caliber .243 Win rifles.
A-Square held the patent 4811666 for the monolithic solid bullet.


== Change in controlling interest ==
From 2010 to February 2012 Sharps Rifle Company LLC owned an 80% controlling interest in A-Square of South Dakota LLC and a 67% controlling interest in A-Square of Wyoming.


== Closure ==
In October 2011, all A-Square employees were dismissed from both the Chamberlain, South Dakota, ammunition plant and the Glenrock, Wyoming, rifle plant.
On February 15, 2012, the A-Square Company ceased to exist. Owner and founder Art Alphin led Sharps Rifle Company LLC, CEO Michael Blank to shut down both A-Square of South Dakota and Wyoming along with Sharps’ main operations in St. Louis.
M. Blank conveyed ownership, all of the equipment, and intangible assets belonging to A-Square of South Dakota LLC and A-Square of Wyoming LLC to the new Sharps Rifle Company Inc., CEO Kevin Tierney and his partner William Martin.
Due to fiscal insolvency and a new company vision neither the ammunition plant in South Dakota nor the rifle plant in Wyoming were reopened.


== New ownership ==
In February 2013, Broadsword Group, LLC acquired the Sharps Rifle Co., which included the sister companies of A-Square rifles and ammunition. New ownership and a new management team are steering a different course for these companies through their headquarters in Glenrock, Wyoming. Sharps has abandoned manufacturing A-Square bolt-action rifles, instead focusing on the AR market. The company produces the patented Relia-bolt, the Balanced Bolt Carrier, barrels, complete uppers, and rifles, all dedicated to the .25-45 Sharps cartridge, which the company offers factory loadings in 87-grain soft-point and 70-grain hollow-point ammunition. This cartridge, based on the parent .223 in/5.56 mm case necked up for .257 bullets, is SAAMI standardized. The company offers properly headstamped virgin brass, as well as remanufactured ammunition from once-fired military 5.56 brass.

=== A-Square (Of Course): The Story of Michigan's Legendary A-Square Records ===
A-Square (Of Course): The Story of Michigan's Legendary A-Square Records is a collection of garage rock songs originally recorded in the 1960s for the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based A-Square label, which has been compiled for this release by Big Beat Records.   Michigan had one of the most active garage rock scenes in the country and Jeep Holland was one of its prime movers, as the owner of one of the city's most premier record stores and founder/proprietor of the A-squared label.  This collection focuses on the pivotal period in the later half of 1960s as garage rock began encompass psychedelic influences and gravitate towards heavier sounds, typified by groups such as MC5, two of whose pre-Elektra songs are showcased here.  All of the tracks are taken off of source tapes from A-Square's vaults.   Noted rock journalist Alec Palao compiled the set and wrote its liner notes.        
The Scot Richard Case (later known as SRC) showcased Scott Richardson's considerable vocal talents and are featured on five tracks, including the opening cut, Skip James's "I'm So Glad", which had recently been popularized by Cream, as well as covers of the Pretty Things' "Get the Picture," "Midnight to Six Man".  MC5 do "Looking at You" and "Borderline"--neither of which was actually released on A-Square.  The group's  manager, John Sinclair, had the A-Square label surreptitiously printed onto MC5's self-released 1968 single.  The Thyme are featured on eight songs here, including "Window Song," "Love to Love" and "Very Last Day".  Dick Wagner, who later went on to work with proto-punk icons such as Alice Cooper and Lou Reed, was first in the Bossmen, whose ranks also included Mark Farner--they do three Wagner-penned numbers "Listen My Girl",  "I Cannot Stop You", which was also covered by the Cherry Slush, and "Easy Way Out"--which was also recorded by Tonto and the Renegades for a single produced by Wagner.   "Mystery Man" is by Wagner's  later group, the Frost.  James Osterberg, later known as Iggy Pop in the Stooges fame, sings and plays drums in the Prime Movers' version of Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man".  The Up's "Just Like an Aborigine" celebrates the kind of radical primitivist ethos adopted by many hippies and radicals in the late 60s.  The guitar riff in Half-Life's "Get Down", recorded in 1969 shares an uncanny resemblance to Black Sabbath's 1971 "Paranoid", which has led some to speculate that the riff was lifted by Tony Iommi.

=== A-Studio ===
A-Studio, stylized as a'studio, is a Russian-based Kazakhstani pop music group originally consisting of  Baigali Serkebayev (keyboard), Vladimir Mikloshich (bass), Baglan Sadvakasov (solo guitar) and frontman Batyrkhan Shukenov (vocal and sax). The band was created in 1982 in Almaty, then called Alma-Ata, hence called "Alma-Ata Studio". Later, the name was changed to "A-Studio". Currently the group's members are Georgian frontwoman Keti Topuria, Baigali Serkebayev and Vladimir Mikloshich. 
During their career, the group achieved popularity in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. In 2015, A-Studio were named best pop group of the year according to the ZD Awards. The group performed a duet with Tomas N'Evergreen with the song "Falling for You". 


== History ==
In 1989, the song "Julia" (Джулия) by the group "A-Studio" was liked by Russian pop icon Alla Pugacheva, who invited the group to perform at her Christmas Meetings music festival in Moscow in 1990.
In 2000, Shukenov left the band to pursue a solo career, while A-Studio introduced a  new vocalist, Polina Griffith. The band released several singles of songs with Griffith on vocals, including "S.O.S", which reached #64 on the UK Singles Chart and gained popularity in Europe and the USA.
In August 2004, Griffith left the band to pursue solo work. As a result, a new vocalist, Keti Topuria, originally from Tbilisi, Georgia, joined A-Studio. Together, they released popularly acclaimed singles such as "Uletayu" ("Flying Away"), "Ty" ("You"), "Noch'-Podruga" ("Night-Friend"). "Uletayu" ("Flying Away") hit the charts in Central Asia and Eastern Europe, bringing renewed popularity to the group. However, this successful new beginning was clouded by the death of Baglan Sadvakasov on 2 August 2006 as the result of a car accident. His place in the band was taken by his son, 17-year-old Tamerlan Sadvakasov. Later, as the younger Sadvakasov left the band to pursue education, Fedor "Federico" Dossumov became the solo-guitarist for A-Studio.
At different times during the late 1990s, A-Studio worked with Greg Walsh, famous UK sound-producer.
Their single, "Fashion Girl", was released in mid-2010 and is included in the album "Volny". It achieved modest popularity in Russia and Eastern Europe. The music video shot for the song was finished on November 8, 2010, according to their official website. In the video, the members of the group are trying to construct a female robot in a laboratory, set in a 1960s-1970s setting. The director of the clip is German Glinski, a Ukrainian video designer. 
In 2017 they performed at the Rendezvous music festival in Jurmala.

=== A-TEC Industries ===
A-TEC Industries AG was an international industrial holding company based in Vienna, Austria. It belonged to the Austrian industrialist Mirko Kovats. A-TEC was quoted on the Vienna stock exchange from the end of 2006 until February 2014. In 2007, the group of companies accounted for nearly 14.000 employees and had a turnover of more than 2 billion Euro. A-TEC was active in the areas of power plant construction, drive technology, industrial engineering and minerals & metals.
In October 2010, A-TEC went bankrupt and the company's assets were sold off by a trustee over the course of four years. The sell-off was completed by mid-2012. This was the third largest insolvency in Austria. The liquidation process began in October 2018.


== History ==
A-TEC Industries AG has undergone several acquisitions since its founding in 2001, and its history is closely intertwined with that of its founder and director, Mirko Kovats. In 2004, the company changed its name from ATB Beteiligungs GmbH to A-Tec Industries GmbH, and the legal form was changed from a GmbH to an AG. An initial public offering (IPO) was completed in 2006 as part of a capital increase, and the shareholder structure as of December 31, 2006 was documented as follows:

55% M.U.S.T. Private Foundation
32% free float shares
7% J.E. Loidold private foundation
6% RPR private foundation
In 2007, Ronny Pecik sold his A-Tec shares, increasing the free shares to 33%.


=== Acquitions ===
Through A-Tec, Kovats frequently engaged in the takeover of economically troubled companies on advantageous terms, after which they underwent restructuring. Notable acquisitions include:


==== Drive technology Division ====
2001 ATB Group from the company of the Federal Republic of Austria for industrial policy measures ("ATB Gruppe von der Gesellschaft des Bundes Österreich für industriepolitische Maßnahmen (GBI)"). ATB is a manufacturer of electric motors specialising in motors for domestic and industrial usage. At the time of acquisition by GBI, ATB had approximately 1,200 employees and reported a consolidated revenue of approximately EUR 142 million. GBI sought a buyer with an industrial background and at the time, Kovats had an interest in the machine tool producer Emco.
2003 ATB Technologies GmbH, Austria
2004 ATB Morley Limited, UK – purchase price EUR 8.3 million.
2004 ATB Selni, France – purchase price EUR 3.2 million. Since the value of the assets less the liabilities of this company was higher than the purchase price, A-Tec recorded negative goodwill of EUR 433 thousand.
2005 ATB Sever, Serbia – purchase price EUR 4.1 million. After a tender, the A-Tec division ATB acquired the 63% shares in the electric motor manufacturer SEVER held by the Serbian state, the rest remained in free float. With the acquisition, ATB expanded its product portfolio to include motors of large sizes, standard motors and high-voltage motors. Sever had 2000 employees and achieved a turnover of 26 million euros. ATB agreed to assume 7 million euros of debt, finance a social plan and invest 16 million euros.
2005/2006 Lindeteves-Jacoberg, Singapore – purchase price EUR 21.8 million. ATB thereby acquired electric motor factories in the UK, Germany, Poland and China, as well as the Schorch, Brook Tamel Crompton and Western Electric brands. As noted in the prospectus, the Lindeteves Group had made a loss since 2003; the company was therefore in need of restructuring. A debt restructuring was carried out.
2007 David McClure, UK – purchase price EUR 0.8 million
2007 Laurence Scott, UK – purchase price EUR 4.7 million. Laurence Scott is a supplier of electric motors (sales EUR 19.4 million) specializing in the oil and gas industry. Due to cash flow problems, he found himself in bankruptcy proceedings in 2007 despite having enough orders. The takeover was carried out by the British ATB subsidiary Morley.


==== Plant Engineering Division ====
2002 Austrian Energy & Environment (AE&E) (Anlagenbau)
2003 Von Roll Inova-Gruppe, Switzerland
2004 Babcock Power Espana, Spain - purchase price EUR 3.7 million. The Spanish state holding company SEPI purchased the boiler-making company previously owned by Babcock Borsig, which employed 400 people at the Bilbao site. As the value of the assets minus liabilities was higher than the purchase price, A-Tec recorded negative goodwill of EUR 30.6 million. SEPI funded the cleanup with roughly EUR 110 million, of which EUR 12 million was generated in profit. A restructuring provision was also recognized in the 2004 financial statements, which totaled EUR 14.4 million for Babcock Espana.
2004 AE&E Chennai Works Ltd. and I.D.E.A. Private Ltd., India - purchase price EUR 6.3 million. The Babcock Borsig Group included two companies: Chennai Works, which specialized in boiler making, and I.D.E.A., which was focused on engineering.
2005 Alstom's boiler and power plant business in Asia and the Pacific region: this was merged into Austrian Energy & Environment (Australia) Pty.ltd - purchase price EUR 7.8 million. The French Alstom group was required to divest the Industrial Boilers and Plants division due to EU requirements, with AE&E taking over significant parts of the division. This included four locations across Europe and Australia, with Sydney (Australia) taken over in 2005 and the other locations in Cologne and Nuremberg (Germany) and Brno (Czech Republic) taken over in 2006. At the time, the division employed 450 people and had a sales volume of approximately EUR 400 million. Christian Schmidt, the CEO of AE&E at the time, saw the German locations as complementary to Von Roll's activities, while the Czech and Australian locations were complementary to AE&E Austria.
2006 Alstom business in Germany and the Czech Republic - this was incorporated into AE&E Inova (Germany) and AE&E CZ - purchase price EUR 1 million.
2007 Global Power Asia/AE&E Nanjing Boiler Co. – purchase price EUR 18.2 million.
2007 Lentjes GmbH, Germany from GEA – purchase price EUR 1.2 million. A-Tec acquired Lentjes for an amount of one euro, with additional costs associated with the purchase. Lentjes specializes in the construction of plants for energy production from fossil fuels, biomass, and waste. As part of the agreement, A-Tec was to increase its capital in the range of the low double-digit millions, while the seller was to take on the risks from largely finished projects. Following a detailed evaluation, the EU Commission gave its approval for the acquisition.
2008 KRB, Switzerland - purchase price EUR 2 million
2008 Mechanical Installations International, UK – purchase price EUR 8 million. A British company specialising in machinery and industrial plant installation, construction, maintenance and servicing, as well as pipe work and steel construction, had 110 employees and a turnover of EUR 21 million in 2007. This company was taken over due to existing orders from AE&E in the area of thermal waste treatment within the United Kingdom.


==== Machine Tool Division ====
2004 EMCO, Austria (machine tool construction). EMCO is a mechanical engineering company headquartered in Hallein, Austria, which in 2006 employed 870 people. In 1997 Mirko Kovats acquired a 50% stake in the company, undertaking a restructuring process and investing 120 million shillings (around 9 million euros) of his own money. By 2003, Kovats owned 100% of the company. In 2004, the private foundation M.U.S.T. acquired 25% of the company, and the majority of votes, for a cost of 20 million euros.
2006 remaining 75% of EMCO - purchase price EUR 70.3 million
2007 Dörries Scharmann Technologie, Germany - purchase price EUR 64.3 million. Dörries Scharmann is a manufacturer of specialised machine tools for automotive, mechanical, and aerospace engineering. AE&E Nanjing Boiler Co., a Chinese company, specialises in the production of industrial and waste heat boilers. With an annual turnover of US$20 million, the company has been identified as a cost-efficient production site by A-Tec.


==== Minerals & Metals Division ====
2004 Montanwerke Brixlegg, Austria (Minerals & Metals) – purchase price EUR 9.7 million. The entity is a copper recycling company with a history of more than 500 years.
2007 Gindre, France – purchase price EUR 29.5 million. Gindre, a French company located in Lyon, specializes in the production of semi-finished copper products and components for the electrical industry. Established in 2006, the company employed 450 people and generated a revenue of 300 million euros. Its operations spanned five countries, including France, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. Through forward integration, Gindre's Minerals & Metals division was further expanded with the Kupferhütte Montanwerke Brixlegg.


==== Other ====
2008 Voitsberg steam power plant, Austria -  purchase price EUR 35 million
In 2006, the Voitsberg lignite-fired power plant was decommissioned and placed up for auction. A-Tec emerged as the victor among the 49 initial bidders, proposing to repurpose the plant to utilize other energy sources in coordination with AE&E.


==== Failed Takeovers ====
In 2007, A-Tec sought to bolster the copper sector by acquiring the Belgian copper group Cumerio, in contrast to Norddeutsche Affinerie (NA). Although A-Tec also acquired a stake in NA, the German Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) barred the takeover of NA, deeming it to create a dominant position in the oxygen-free continuous cast copper shapes market. This series of events was dubbed the "copper thriller" by the media. By early 2008, A-Tec had sold off its Cumerio shares and, by the summer, relinquished its stake in NA.
Later in the year, A-Tec's attempt to purchase Serbian copper smelter RTB Bor fell through due to the company's failure to pay the full purchase price in time. In the same year, A-Tec moved to acquire the Ugandan copper mine Kilembe, as well as a copper smelter in the country.


=== Financial market transactions ===
On November 2, 2005, A-Tec INDUSTRIES AG issued a bond (ISIN AT0000499272) in the amount of EUR 100 million with a 5.75% interest rate, payable upon maturity on November 2, 2010.
The A-Tec share (ISIN AT00000ATEC9) was listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange in December 2006, reaching its highest point of EUR 48 in the summer of 2007. By mid-July 2009, the share had dropped to a value of nearly EUR 9.
A convertible bond (ISIN AT0000A05CS2) with a volume of EUR 180 million was issued on May 3, 2007, with a coupon rate of 2.75%. The bond was due to be repaid in 2014 and included a conversion right, which was valid until April 18, 2014, allowing creditors to convert the bonds into shares at a conversion price of EUR 56.25 per share. In the second half of 2009, A-Tec bought back a portion of the bond, which reduced the outstanding volume to around 92 million euros.
On October 27, 2009, A-Tec Industries issued a convertible bond (ISIN AT0000A0F795) with a nominal value of EUR 110 million and an 8.75% interest rate, maturing in 2014. Creditors were granted the right to convert the bonds into shares of A-Tec stock at a conversion price of EUR 14.76 per share until October 7, 2014.
In June 2010, A-Tec attempted to issue another bond but failed, with no ad hoc announcement informing the public of the failure. As a result, in 2012, the Financial Market Authority fined both Mirko Kovats and Christian Schmidt a total of EUR 130,000.
On October 5, 2010, A-Tec made an ad hoc announcement disclosing major orders with a volume of approximately one billion. However, at the time of the announcement, it had already been reported to the Financial Market Authority that the financing for these orders had not been secured. As a result, in 2012, Mirko Kovats, Christian Schmid and Franz Fehringer were each fined an additional EUR 200,000.


== The insolvency proceedings of A-Tec - Part 1 ==
On 20 October 2010, A-Tec announced the commencement of insolvency proceedings. According to the company itself, the filing of the 'reorganisation proceedings with self-administration' was due to difficulties in connection with the refinancing of a bond and the deterioration of the economic situation of the Australian subsidiary of the AE&E Group. With debts of over 350 million euros as of 2010, it was the third largest bankruptcy in Austrian economic history.
An article in Industrie magazine accuses the Executive Board of the A-Tec subgroup AE&E of deception through accounting tricks. In addition to the public and banks, Mirko Kovats was also affected.
Share trading on the Wiener Börse was suspended. When trading resumed on 22 October, the share price fell by 65%. The share is no longer traded on the prime market, but only on the standard market continuous.


== Insolvency of the Plant Engineering Division (AE&E Group) ==
As the banks subsequently cut the loans and a sale was also not possible, the A-Tec subsidiary AE&E Group GmbH, the holding company of the AE&E subgroup, had to file for insolvency (restructuring without self-administration) in Vienna on 23 November 2010. The holding company had 50 employees, the AE&E Group had 600 employees throughout Austria and 5,200 employees worldwide. AE&E Group GmbH was closed on 3 December 2010. Shortly afterwards, the proceedings became bankruptcy proceedings, as a result of which A-Tec lost control of the AE&E Group. On 26 November 2010, the operating company AE&E Austria GmbH & Co. KG also had to file for insolvency.
On 3 December, the purchase of AE & E Austria by Andritz AG was confirmed. This was achieved by the newly founded Andritz Energy & Environment GmbH taking over projects and most of the employees as a rescue company.
For AE&E Austria GmbH & Co. KG, a reorganisation plan was adopted in July 2011. According to this plan, non-preferential creditors will receive a quota of 20%. In addition, there is the chance of a super quota from the realisation of the assets handed over to the liquidator, namely, among other things, claims for damages against the company's executive bodies, against A-Tec Industries AG and its executive bodies, against M.U.S.T. Privatstiftung and Loidold Privatstiftung and their companies and executive bodies. The assets also include claims against A-Tec Beteiligungs GmbH in relation to the Voitsberg power plant.
In February 2013, it was planned to pay out a (partial) super quota of 15% to the creditors. In June 2013, the deadline for the monitoring of AE&E Austria GmbH & Co. KG by the trustee was extended to 18 July 2016 and a further extension to 18 July 2019 was granted in July 2016.
The Swiss intermediate holding company AE&E Inova Holding AG had to apply for debt-restructuring moratorium in December 2010, as a loan to AE&E Group GmbH had to be written off.
As a result, other subsidiaries of the AE&E Group were also sold:

AE&E Von Roll Inova, Switzerland to Hitachi Zosen, Japan
AE&E KRB AG, to Hitachi Zosen, Japan
AE&E Inc., USA to Hitachi Zosen, USA
AE&E Inova France SA, AE&E Maintenance France S.A.S., AE&E Inova France Operations S.A.S. an Altawest SAS
Đuro Đaković TEP, Croatia to EM Alliance, Russia
Lentjes, Germany to Doosan, Korea
AE&E Inova GmbH, Germany, had to file for insolvency in November 2010. The Japanese IHI Corporation acquired the plant and boiler construction division, Keppel Seghers the expertise in waste incineration plants and enpros the engineering division.
AE&E CZ, s.r.o., Czech Republic went to Bilfinger Berger in 2011
AE&E Chennai Works Ltd. und I.D.E.A. Private Ltd. an Doosan (Südkorea) und Dodsal (Indien) – Verkaufspreis 20 Millionen EUR
AE&E Australia also had to file for insolvency and was then sold to RCR Tomlinson. Physical assets, intellectual property and technologies were acquired, but no liabilities for projects that arose before the company was sold.
RCR Tomlinson received a fixed payment of around 2.5 million Australian dollars (AUD). In addition, a performance-related payment of a maximum of AUD 5 million was agreed. RCR Tomlinson recognised a profit of AUD 3.7 million from this acquisition in its 2011 balance sheet.

The Spanish subsidiary Babcock Power Espana had to file for insolvency in 2011. The Spanish state holding SEPI filed claims for damages for breach of contract against A-Tec, AE&E Group GmbH and AE&E Austria GmbH & Co KG. SEPI received EUR 10.6 million from the AE&E Austria quota in July 2011.
AE&E Mechanical Installations International Ltd. had to file for insolvency in November 2011.
AE&E Financial Services GmbH (founded to process payment transactions within the AE&E Group) went into liquidation on 22 February 2012 and was deleted on 15 January 2013 following its termination.
In January 2013, the bankrupt AE&E Group GmbH made an interim distribution of 7%. A further pro rata distribution of 7% was made as at December 2015. A further 3.3 % was distributed as at January 2020.


== The insolvency proceedings of A-TEC - Part 2 ==


=== The reorganisation plan ===
At the end of December 2010, the creditors of A-TEC accepted a restructuring plan that was to be finalised by 30 December 2010. An investor had to be found for the A-TEC Group by 30 June 2011, whereby the 47% quota had to be paid by the end of September 2011. In absolute figures, the investor was expecting an investment of 250 million euros.
According to a valuation report, the remaining subgroups ATB, Emco including Dörries Scharmann and Montanwerke Brixlegg were to be valued as follows: ATB at between -7.1 and +15.4 million euros and the others together at between 147 and 212 million euros.
Insolvency proceedings were opened against the holding company of the Dörries Scharmann Group, A-TEC Mechanical Engineering Investment GmbH (AMEI), in mid-December 2010 at the request of two banks.
On 17 January 2011, the German-Swiss Starrag announced the acquisition of the Dörries Scharmann Group. The purchase agreement was concluded on 19 January for an amount of 70 million euros. The insolvency proceedings against AMEI were then terminated. As can be seen from the published 2011 annual financial statements of this company, A-TEC Mechanical Engineering Investment GmbH realised a profit of around EUR 2.8 million from the sale of the investment.
On 15 June 2011, A-TEC CEO Mirko Kovats presented A-TEC's 2010 annual balance sheet with a record loss of EUR 584.5 million.
The annual financial statements of the A-TEC subgroup ATB were also presented in June 2011: ATB reported a net loss for the period of EUR 107 million. The strongly negative result was mainly caused by high amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, which amounted to 91 million euros (previous year: 2 million euros). ATB was severely affected by the reorganisation process at A-TEC: the loss of confidence among banks, credit insurers, suppliers and customers made financing more difficult. A-TEC came to the aid of ATB to the extent that A-TEC Industries AG and its subsidiary AE&E Energy AG converted loan receivables totalling 80 million including interest into hybrid capital: repayment does not have to be made until the Annual General Meeting of ATB Austria Antriebstechnik AG passes a resolution to this effect. In addition, A-TEC made a shareholder contribution totalling EUR 25 million in December 2010. However, A-TEC's ability to finance ATB has been severely limited since the reorganisation proceedings were initiated.
Loan deferrals were agreed with some banks.
Capital increases were carried out at the ATB subsidiary ATB Sever at the beginning of 2011. The balance sheet reorganisation was completed through the contribution of receivables, capital contributions and debt waivers totalling around EUR 38 million. In April 2011, the loss-making Industrial Motors division of ATB Sever was discontinued, resulting in the loss of 283 jobs.
Towards the end of June 2011, it became known that A-TEC was still negotiating with five interested parties, including the British-French financial investor Astorg, the Indian steel group Essar and the Czech-Slovak investor Penta.
In July 2011, the Vienna public prosecutor's office carried out a house search at A-TEC, as investigations were underway against several members of the Management Board on the basis of a complaint for fraudulent bankruptcy and balance sheet falsification, among other things.
In the same month, the restructuring administrator's report was also published, in which he stated, among other things, that:

the Group had grown rapidly through the acquisition of economically weak industrial companies
the Group had a low equity ratio
the liquidity planning did not take into account unforeseen events
USD 93 million was invested in corporate jets and EUR 40 million in the Voitsberg power plant and a plot of land
In September 2011, the plan was to raise the quota of 200 million euros as follows: ATB was to go to the Chinese Wolong Group via Contor Industries GmbH, Minerals & Metals to Solstice International and the Voitsberg power plant to Palmsquare. Emco would have remained with A-TEC. Contor Industries GmbH was founded in June 2011, with former A-TEC employee Thomas Schätti as managing director and sole shareholder. The business address of this company was that of A-Tec Industries AG and the share capital was only EUR 35,000. However, Mirko Kovats denied that it was a shell company. According to the A-TEC Management Board's report, Contor Industries GmbH's role was only to coordinate the bids; the contracts were concluded directly with the individual bidders.
According to the Management Board's report, there were two counter-offers, but these were rejected:

Investor Springwater Capital LLC: loan of up to EUR 100 million and a bond of EUR 110 million - here, price stability in the Copper Division was required, which could not be guaranteed.
Investor Penta: In this case, a special purpose entity (Vysehrad Holding B.V., Netherlands) would have taken over the entire assets of A-TEC and paid the quota in return. A-Tec would have held a 20% stake in this special purpose entity, but would hardly have been able to receive any returns as the special purpose entity was heavily leveraged: Vysehrad would only have had 20 million euros in equity, and Penta would have lent Vysehrad the additional 190 million euros required at an interest rate of 20%.
In addition, extensive warranties would have had to be assumed.
However, Penta filed a lawsuit against the sale via Contor. As a result, the Pakistani investor behind Solstice, Alshair Fiyaz, withdrew his offer.


=== Realisation by the trustee ===
The sale subsequently fell through and the companies are now being sold individually. Following the failure of the reorganisation and takeover by new investors, the share price fell to EUR 0.84 in October 2011. The Vienna Stock Exchange suspended the share from trading. The trustee, Matthias Schmidt, carries out the realisation of A-TEC's assets.


==== Realisation of the other divisions ====
On 19 October 2011, the trustee sold the Drive Technology division (ATB Group) to the Chinese Wolong Group, generating proceeds of around EUR 53 million.
The sale of the EMCO Group to Salzburg-based Kuhn Holding for around EUR 34 million took place on 20 December 2011. In addition, the buyer has a contingent liability of EUR 4 million, of which it is claiming EUR 2.4 million. This means that EUR 1.6 million is still outstanding (as at June 2013).
The Minerals & Metals division (Montanwerke Brixlegg and Gindre) was sold to Umcor from Switzerland for around EUR 86 million on 10 February 2012. In addition, the buyer has a contingent liability in the amount of EUR 11 million, which he is claiming in full. The trustee has accepted EUR 3 million of this, the remainder is still being negotiated (as at June 2013).


==== Realisation of other assets and investments outside the divisions ====
Assets and investments outside the divisions developed as follows:

In February 2012, the subsidiary A-Jet, which operated the Group's own jets, had to file for bankruptcy. It thus became one of a series of bankruptcies of Austrian commercial aviation companies, whose other victims included MAIN Aviation Project GmbH & Co Falcon KG, Comtel Air and M.A.P. Management + Planning GmbH.
A-Jet also got into difficulties due to the A-TEC insolvency. Its former managing director Peter Tutschek had also found investors, but it was allegedly not possible to get them on board because Kovats had demanded too high a price. 15 employees had to be made redundant.
According to Tutschek, A-Jet was already insolvent at the end of 2010 and he also wanted to file for insolvency. According to Tutschek, A-Jet was already insolvent at the end of 2010 and he had also wanted to file for insolvency, but Mirko Kovats did not want to jeopardise the restructuring of A-TEC. For this reason, A-Tec CFO Franz Fehringer took over the management of the company in mid-January 2011. In December 2011, the trustee appointed Gert Burgmann as managing director instead of Fehringer. Tutschek argued with A-Jet before the labour court.
Shortly before the insolvency, the Ministry of Transport withdrew the company's flight licence (Air operator's certificate). However, this licence would have been essential for an investor. The background to the licence revocation was that Franz Fehringer, as A-Jet managing director, had not provided the ministry with the relevant information about the financial situation.
According to Kovats, Tutschek's statements were incorrect; Bergmann was to blame for the bankruptcy, as employees had badmouthed A-Jet to the authorities due to unpaid salaries.
It also became known that there had been strange flows of money to Bahrain during the Fehringer era.
The bankruptcy rate of A-Jet is 11.8917%.

A company jet (leased from A-TEC subsidiary Challenger Anlagenvermietung GmbH) was sold to the USA in April 2012 for USD 15.5 million. The aircraft in question was a Bombardier Challenger 300, and the lessor received 14.9 million dollars from the proceeds of the sale.
A bankruptcy petition was filed in May 2012 for i.Dream Media Services GmbH, which also belongs to A-TEC, but this was rejected due to a lack of assets.
A-TEC's stake in Drum Beteiligungsverwaltungs GmbH, Brunn am Gebirge (1%) was transferred to the majority shareholder, Reinhardt Salusek, in November 2012.
A-TEC PETRO GmbH, Vienna, was officially deleted from the commercial register in May 2013 due to lack of assets.
90 % of this company was owned by E-TEC Beteiligungsverwaltungs GmbH, a subsidiary of A-TEC Industries AG (which acquired it from A-TEC Minerals & Metals Management GmbH, also a subsidiary of A-TEC Industries AG, in November 2011). The remaining 10 % belonged to Sergey Ilin, who was also managing director. The legal basis for the cancellation was § 40 of the Commercial Register Act, which stipulates that a company that does not obviously have assets can be cancelled if it does not submit the annual financial statements for two consecutive financial years and the existence of assets is not proven. The company had not published its annual financial statements for 2010 and 2011 until May 2013.
Nevertheless, formal liquidation proceedings were decided in May 2014 and Gert Bergmann was appointed as liquidator. The annual financial statements for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 have now been submitted.
The company was cancelled again in March 2015, but this time due to the end of liquidation.

The Voitsberg power plant (owned by A-Tec Beteiligungs GmbH) was sold to Porr Umwelttechnik GmbH in January 2013. Porr demolishes the power plant and recycles the materials (non-ferrous metals, scrap, etc.). Following the dismantling of Blocks I and II, Porr sold Block III to Romanian investors in March 2014. Porr will sell the property once the work has been completed. Porr paid EUR 4 million and expects a substantial profit from the utilisation of the materials. The creditors were left with only a small amount of proceeds, as the conservation costs of the power plant and the claims of the insolvent AE&E Austria GmbH & Co. KG (see above) had to be settled first.
Also up for sale was the right to lease a property at Vienna Airport. This was a 60-year lease agreement. The A-TEC Group headquarters were to have been built on the site, but this never materialised due to insolvency. In the end, the matter was resolved by Vienna Airport receiving EUR 500,000 from the reorganisation administrator and the contract was thus terminated in July 2013.
Energy Investment Kraftwerkerrichtung AG was deleted from the commercial register in August 2013 due to lack of assets.
The company was founded in 2009. Mirko Kovats and Christian Schmidt were appointed as members of the Management Board. Christian Schmidt was now the sole member of the Management Board after Mirko Kovats was removed from the Management Board in September 2012. The company has not yet (June 2013) published any annual financial statements. A-TEC Industries AG held a 99.99% stake in this company, while Mirko Kovats held 0.01%. According to the information in the 2012 annual financial statements of A-TEC Industries AG, Energy Investment Kraftwerkerrichtung AG had negative equity of around EUR 3,000 as at 31 December 2012.

A-Tec Beteiligungs GmbH, Mönchengladbach, Germany, went into liquidation in June 2014. The liquidator is Franz Fehringer. The company's last published balance sheet dates back to 2006 and it was deleted from the commercial register in June 2019.
A merger plan was submitted for this cross-border merger in November 2012, the merger was entered in the commercial register in February 2013 and A-TEC Mechanical Engineering Investment GmbH was deleted from the commercial register in March 2013. According to the last available balance sheet from 2011, the company had assets of around EUR 13.7 million following the sale of its stake in the Dörries Scharmann Group (in January 2011, see above) and the repayment of all debts. There were only provisions totalling around EUR 80,000.

=== A-Teens ===
A-Teens (stylized as A*Teens) is a Swedish pop music group from Stockholm. The group was formed by Niklas Berg in 1998 as an ABBA tribute group called ABBA-Teens, which was later renamed A-Teens. The band members are Marie Serneholt, Amit Paul, Dhani Lennevald, and Sara Lumholdt. The group is best known for the singles "Mamma Mia" (1999), "Upside Down" (2000) and "Floorfiller" (2002), all of which were hits worldwide. The group was particularly successful in their home country where they amassed ten top 10 hit singles on the Swedish charts.
After six years together, the group disbanded following the release of their Greatest Hits album in May 2004. They reunited as a group in 2024.


== History ==


=== 1998–2000: The ABBA Generation ===

In 1998, Marie, Sara, Dhani, and Amit came together to form the ABBA-Teens and began recording their debut album which would consist entirely of covers of ABBA songs. Their first single, "Mamma Mia", was first released in April 1999 in their native Sweden where it stayed at number one for eight consecutive weeks. Following this release, the group's name was changed to the A-Teens to avoid litigation. "Mamma Mia" was released internationally following their name change and became a top 20 hit in over ten countries.

In August 1999, the group released their debut album The ABBA Generation, consisting entirely of ABBA covers reinterpreted with a modern pop and electronic sound. The album reached number one in Sweden and Argentina. In the United States, the album peaked at seventy-one on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart and was certified Gold. The album sold more than 2 million copies worldwide and was certified Gold or Platinum in over 22 countries. Further singles from the album were hits in Sweden: "Super Trouper" peaked at number two and "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) peaked at number ten; both songs charted moderately worldwide. "Happy New Year" was released as a standalone single in Sweden at the end of 1999 and peaked at number four.
In March 2000, the group released the single "Dancing Queen". The single reached ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100. Coinciding with this release, the band embarked on a promotional tour of the United States and was an opening act for the Britney Spears tour later that summer.

The album was preceded by the single "Upside Down" in October 2000; this was their first single that was not an ABBA cover song. It peaked at number two in Sweden and was certified 2× Platinum. The song reached the top ten in several countries. In the United States, the song was released with the alternate title "Bouncing Off the Ceiling (Upside Down)".

=== A-Tisket, A-Tasket ===
"A-Tisket, A-Tasket" (Roud Folk Song Index 13188) is a nursery rhyme first recorded in North America in the late 19th century. The melody to which the nursery rhyme is sung recurs in other nursery rhymes including "It's Raining, It's Pouring"; "Rain Rain Go Away" and "Ring around the Rosie". It was further used as the basis for a successful 1938 recording by Ella Fitzgerald, composed by Fitzgerald in conjunction with Al Feldman (later known as Van Alexander).


== Traditional lyrics ==
The rhyme was first noted in the United States in 1879 as a children's rhyming game. It was sung while children danced in a circle. One of them would run on the outside of the circle and drop a handkerchief. The nearest child then had to pick it up and chase the dropper. If caught, the dropper would join the circle. An early noted version had the lyrics:

A-tisket a-tasket
A green and yellow basket
I wrote a letter to my friend
And on the way I dropped it,
I dropped it, I dropped it,
And on the way I dropped it.
A little boy he picked it up
And put it in his pocket.
In some variants, the second line is "I lost my yellow basket".
In other variants, the last line is "A little girl she picked it up and put it in her pocket".
In 19th century England, the rhyme used in the same game had somewhat different but evidently related words:

I lost my supper, last night,
And the night before,
And if I do this night,
I never will no more.
I sent a letter to my love,
I carried water in my glove,
And by the way I dropped it, I did so, I did so:
I had a little dog that said bow-wow!
I had a little cat that said meow-meow!
Shan't bite you, shan't bite you,
Shall bite you.
I dropt it, I dropt it,
And by the way I lost it.


== Lyrics by Ella Fitzgerald ==

Ella Fitzgerald and Al Feldman (later known as Van Alexander), extended and embellished the rhyme into a jazz piece that was her breakthrough hit with the Chick Webb Orchestra in 1938. It has since become a jazz standard. The lyrics changed the color of the basket to brown and yellow. In Fitzgerald's version a little girl picks up the note and then takes the basket after it is carelessly left on the ground. A follow-up song written by Fitzgerald and Webb entitled "I Found My Yellow Basket" (1938) was less successful.


== In popular culture ==


=== As a recording ===
The song was a major hit of the "pre-chart" era, reaching number one on Billboard's Sheet Music and Record Buying Guide (jukebox) charts and number one on Your Hit Parade.
The Platters recorded a version of the song called "A Tisket A Tasket" in 1959.
The song was included on actress-singer Hayley Mills' 1961 album Let's Get Together with Hayley Mills titled "Green and Yellow Basket", with extra verses describing how the dropper felt about losing the letter.
Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album On the Happy Side (1962).
Lines from the song have been mentioned by Stevie Ray Vaughan, Prince, Half Man Half Biscuit, Ganksta N-I-P, The Shangri-Las, Scarface, Richie Rich, Eminem, Madonna and Boondox.
Nabisco did a "take-off" of the song for its advertising campaign in the 1970s, with the lyrics "A Triscuit, A Triscuit, baked only by Nabisco".


=== In movies ===
The song was used in the opening of the movie The Cowboy and the Lady (1938), but was not credited.  Parts of it were played by an orchestra, used as background music, and sung by Harry Davenport.
Curly Howard recites a paraphrase of the (non-musical) rhyme in the Three Stooges short We Want Our Mummy (1939).
The music for the song was used in the opening scene of John Ford's 1940 film The Grapes of Wrath to help establish the contemporary time frame of the events of the film.
Fitzgerald performed the song in the Abbott and Costello film Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942).
A rendition of the song was also performed in the Paul Thomas Anderson movie The Master (2012).


=== In video games ===
The song "A-Tisket, A-Tasket" was used as the song for Playtime in the 2018 horror game Baldi's Basics. It plays on a loop everytime when the aforementioned character is near the player.


== Literary references ==
The Fitzgerald song and its follow up (in which the Yellow Basket is found) feature centrally in Ali Smith's 2008 short story, The Second Person.

=== A-Tivi ===
A-Tivi was a Dutch subscription television channel targeting immigrants from the Dutch Caribbean. The channel's content was sourced from television channels in Aruba and Curaçao, airing primarily in Papiamento. Programming included news, game shows, talk-shows and Venezuelan telenovelas; the news service from TeleCuraçao was relayed live by satellite.


== History ==
A-Tivi started broadcasting in January 2003 on UPC, in time for the 2003 Tumba Festival. During UPC's free preview at launch, it carried highlights of the previous year's edition. A subscription at launch cost €15. On 22 December 2003, its coverage extended to Multikabel, then in June 2004, to Caiway, which had just started its digital cable service.
In January 2005, A-Tivi signed an agreement with Casema to carry the channel in its digital service from April.
At the end of 2007, the Dutch cable merger between @Home, Multikabel and Casema, which would lead to the creation of Ziggo, made its combined offer public, and among the notable absentees was A-Tivi. Several cable companies in the Netherlands have refused to continue carrying the channel, which led to the announcement of its closure on 1 February 2008. The channel was also known for its poor image quality.

=== A-Town Blues ===
A-Town Blues is the fourth studio album by the American country musician Wayne Hancock, released in 2001.


== Production ==
The album was recorded at Cedar Creek Studios, in Austin, Texas, and was produced by Lloyd Maines. Hancock intended to make a simpler, less-produced album. The band only minimally rehearsed the songs, and laid down the tracks in 20 hours; the results were mixed in two days. A-Town Blues was made with Hancock's road band. Many of the songs are about travel, highway pilgrimages, and the road. 


== Critical reception ==
The Austin Chronicle wrote that the album "swings like crazy, there's some top-notch playing, and Hancock certainly knows his way around a country-blues song." The Los Angeles Times thought that "the music is vibrant, as shimmering steel and chattering electric guitars dance over swinging bass lines." The Columbus Dispatch wrote that "Hancock's tunes bring home the bacon with the stylistic accuracy of the old honky-tonk masters."

=== A-Town Down Under ===
A-Town Down Under is a villainous professional wrestling tag team consisting of Austin Theory and Grayson Waller. They are signed to WWE and perform on the Raw brand, when part of the SmackDown brand they are former one-time WWE Tag Team Champions.


== History ==


=== Formation, SmackDown! roster and WWE Tag Team Champions (2023–2024) ===
As part of the 2023 WWE Draft, both Waller & Theory were drafted to the SmackDown brand. On the September 22, 2023 episode of SmackDown, Theory and Waller teamed up to defeat The Brawling Brutes (Butch and Ridge Holland) in a match. On the October 13 episode of SmackDown, Theory and Waller challenged Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship in a losing effort. On the November 10 episode of SmackDown, Waller and Theory provoked the newest member of the SmackDown roster Kevin Owens, resulting in Owens attacking both of them and being kayfabe suspended by the WWE. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown, both Waller and Theory lost in the first rounds of the United States Championship #1 Contender Tournament to Carmelo Hayes and Owens respectively. On the January 12, 2024 episode of SmackDown, Theory faced Hayes, but their match ended in a shoot no-contest after both of them landed on their heads from the top rope. WWE later announced that they only suffered face contusions and Theory proceeded to defeat Hayes in their rematch on the January 26 episode of SmackDown after interference from Waller.
On February 24 at Elimination Chamber: Perth, Theory and Waller co-hosted The Grayson Waller Effect featuring Cody Rhodes and World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins. After imitating The Rock, Rhodes and Rollins attacked Theory while Waller did not get involved, teasing the dissolution of A-Town Down Under. Nevertheless, Theory and Waller entered a tag team tournament, defeating The O.C. (Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows) on the March 22 episode of SmackDown and The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) in the finals a week later to qualify for the six-pack ladder match for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania XL. At Night 1 of WrestleMania XL, Waller retrieved the SmackDown Tag Team Championship for A-Town Down Under to become the new champions, although they failed to win the Raw Tag Team Championship as that was won by The Awesome Truth (R-Truth and The Miz). On the April 19 episode of SmackDown, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was renamed as the WWE Tag Team Championship and the team was presented with new title belts by WWE chief content officer Paul "Triple H" Levesque and SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. On the May 3 episode of SmackDown, A-Town Down Under defeated The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) in their first title defense. On the July 5 episode of SmackDown, A-Town Down Under lost the titles to #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa), ending their reign at 90 days. Austin Theory and Grayson Waller also had previously feuded with #DIY weeks before the title loss. They failed to win the titles in a rematch on the following episode of SmackDown, ending their feud. After a promo on twitter A-Town Down Under got a NXT tag title shot Oct 8th.


==== Championship pursuits (2024–present) ====
On the September 6, 2024 episode of SmackDown A-Town Down Under faced Kevin Owens in a 2-on-1 handicap match but were unsuccessful as Theory was pinned, after the match Waller carried on the attack on Kevin Owens and the two double teamed Owens and then left. On the September 13, 2024 episode of SmackDown Austin Theory and Grayson Waller faced Kevin Owens & his mystery partner Randy Orton in a tag team match but were unsuccessful.
After a promo on social media the previous week, Theory and Waller returned to NXT on September 24, challenging Fraxiom (Nathan Frazer and Axiom) for the NXT Tag Team Championship, which they accepted. Later that night, they defeated Cedric Alexander and Je'Von Evans following a backstage confrontation. On the October 8 episode of NXT, they failed to win the titles from Fraxiom.


=== Raw roster (2025–present) ===
On the January 24 episode of SmackDown, it was announced by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis that A-Town Down Under would be moving to the Raw brand as part of the transfer window. On the January 28 episode of NXT, A-Town Down Under hosted a special edition of The Grayson Waller Effect with the new NXT Champion Oba Femi as guest to see if Femi was "worth the hype." Femi then offered to defend the NXT Championship in a triple threat match against A-Town Down Under at NXT Vengeance Day on February 15, where Femi retained the title after Waller costed Theory the win.

=== A-Train ===
A-Train (A列車で行こう, Ē Ressha de Ikō, lit. Take the A-Train) is a series of business simulation video games developed and published by Japanese game developer Artdink in Japan. The first game in the series was published in 1985. The first release in the United States was Take the A-Train II, published in 1988 by the Seika Corporation under the title Railroad Empire. However, the most well known U.S. release is Take the A-Train III, published in 1992 by Maxis as simply A-Train. There is also the spin-off title C.E.O.


== A-Train ==
The first iteration of the A-Train series was released in December 1985 for the FM-7, NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, X1 Turbo, MZ-2500, Famicom, and MSX2. A Microsoft Windows port followed in April 2000.


== A-Train II ==
The second iteration of the A-Train series was released in July 1988 for the NEC PC-9801 and X68000. In the US, it was released under the name Railroad Empire.


== A-Train III ==

Take the A-Train III (known internationally as A-Train) is the third game in the A-Train series. It was originally developed and published by Japanese game developer Artdink for Japan, and was later published by Maxis for the United States. It was originally released in December 1990 for the NEC PC-9801, FM Towns Marty, X68000, and PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16). The US version was released in October 1992 on DOS and Amiga. Later, the Japanese version was re-released in March 2000 for Windows 95 and 98. Artdink ported the A-Train III along with the editor to Windows 95, and published both titles as a package as the 3rd ARTDINK BEST CHOICE title in Japan.
The game puts players in command of a railway company. There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the city and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. A-Train III is the first game in the series to make use of near-isometric dimetric projection to present the city, similar to Maxis's later SimCity 2000. There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself.  As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right, and if these areas are populated enough.
A.III. Map Construction, known internationally as A-Train Construction Set, is an editor that can change existing saved games, or to build landscapes from scratch. It comes with 6 sample maps.  Maxis also published A-Train Construction Set with A-Train as a single package in Europe, without the Ocean Software label.

Computer Gaming World's reviewer stated in 1992 that while he enjoyed the financial and management aspects of A-Train, "many people will miss out on a fine program because of a steeply graded learning curve".
The game was reviewed in 1992 in Dragon #187 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. In 1993 the game received a Codie award from the Software Publishers Association for Best Strategy Program. A-Train's isometric, tile-based graphics and animated elements inspired the visual style Maxis went on to adopt for Simcity 2000 in 1993.
In 1994, PC Gamer UK named A-Train III the 46th best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, "Fascinating, absorbing and now quite cheap, A-Train is worth a place in any games collection—and don't be put off by the subject matter. It's brilliant fun."


== MD A-Train ==
A Ressha de Ikō MD (Ａ列車で行こうＭＤ, "MD A-Train") is a simulation game involving the construction of a railroad in order to boost the city's mass transit system. The game was released to an exclusively Japanese market; with no release ever being attempted for the North American or European markets.
The player must use the resources at hand to build a railroad connecting the two ends of a map in each scenario. A train can be controlled throughout the day (05:00–17:00) while building new tracks and stations. Nighttime activities (17:00–05:00) involve changing train schedules to better suit the needs of the player's growing mass transportation hub. New developments will spring up around the tracks and stations. This permits the player to increase the amount of money that can earn; resulting in the increased ability to build railroad tracks and stations for the growing city. Five scenarios offer a tutorial mode for first-time players, an extremely hard scenario for veterans, and three more scenarios for players in between the two extremes in difficulty levels. Players can play using speeds that range from slow to normal to fast.


== A-Train IV ==
Released in December 1993 for the NEC PC-9801, FM Towns Marty, Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. It was later re-released on March 17, 2000, for Windows 95 and 98 under the title A-Train 4 15th Anniversary, and again on March 26, 2004, under the name A-Train 4 XP, this time including support for Windows 2000 and XP. Related versions include the Japan-only console launch title release AIV: Evolution in December 1994 for the PS1 and AIV: Evolution Global (released under the title A-Train in North America), also for the PS1, and re-released in January 2007 for the PSP and PS3 and AIV Network$ (known as C.E.O. in North America) in 1995 for MS-DOS and Windows 3.1. Also released in North America was the "A Train Evolution Pack", which included the PlayStation version of AIV: Evolution Global, a PlayStation Mouse, an A Train mousepad, and a PlayStation memory card.

On release, Famitsu PS scored the Japanese PlayStation version of AIV: Evolution a 27 out of 40. Five months later, Famitsu magazine's Reader Cross Review gave it a 9 out of 10, and the following week Famitsu scored it a 31 out of 40. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were divided about the PlayStation version of AIV: Evolution Global; Andrew Baran and Mark Lefebvre described it as an addictive and pleasantly time-consuming simulation, while Mike Desmond and Sushi-X felt it to be dull compared to most simulation games, especially other Maxis titles. They scored it 28 out of 40 (average 7 out of 10). Like Desmond and Sushi-X, GamePro felt the game "just doesn't roll with the same FunFactor of other sim games." Next Generation said it was "a quality management title. Unlikely to set the world aflame, however."

=== A-Train (Korail) ===
A-Train aka Jeongseon Arirang A-Train (Korean: 정선아리랑열차) is a South Korean tourist train operated by Korail. The train began operations in 2015 and transports tourists through Jeongseon County in central Gangwon-do.


== Overview ==
The train opened on January 22, 2015, from Cheongnyangni Station in northeastern Seoul and passes through several stations in Gangwon-do, including Mindungsan and Jeongseon, which hosts the "Jeongseon Five-day Market", and arriving at Auraji Station.
The "A" in the train's name comes from "Arirang" (a Korean folk song), and the words "amazement" and "adventure". The song has many variations, and the Jeongseon Arirang is a regional one. The song is listed as an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO and sometimes regarded as an unofficial anthem of Korea.
The train has four themed cars with large windows and glass walls; one is a sky room, one a tea room, and two of the cars are decorated in regional colors of red, yellow, blue and purple representing Jeongseon's geographical features such as the Dong River and the mountain ridges. The train's exterior includes a purple color for the pulsatilla, Jeongseon's official flower, and is decorated with curves that symbolize the Arirang melody. Activities on the train include storytelling, music, magic shows and quiz games.
The new line to Jeongseon is the first train to be named after a Korean town, and generated additional local interest due to the proximity of the scheduled 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, a nearby town. 

On February 19, 2024, the track was damaged due to a rockfall between Mindungsan Mountain and Byeoleogok, and service between Mindungsan Mountain and Auraji was suspended indefinitely from the 22nd.


== Operations ==
Started running: January 22, 2015
Stations: Cheongnyangni station - Mindungsan station - Byeoreogok station - Sonpyong station - Jeongseon station - Najeon station - Auraji station
Approximate travel time:  3 Hours

=== A-Train III ===
A-Train III, known internationally as A-Train, is a 1990 computer game, is the third game in the A-Train series. It was originally developed and published by Japanese game developer Artdink for Japan, and was later published by Maxis for the United States.


== Overview ==
The game places players in command of a railway company. There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the city and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. A-Train III is the first game in the series to use a near-isometric dimetric projection to present the city, similar to the later SimCity 2000 by Maxis.
There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow.
Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself.
As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right.


== Editor ==
A.III. MAP CONSTRUCTION, known internationally as A-Train Construction Set, is an editor that can change existing saved games, or to build landscapes from scratch. It comes with 6 sample maps.
Maxis also published A-Train Construction Set with A-Train as a single package in Europe, without the Ocean Software label.


== Windows version ==
Artdink ported the A-Train III along with the editor to Windows 95, and published both titles as a package as the 3rd ARTDINK BEST CHOICE title in Japan.


== Maxis distribution and ports ==
The game was tremendously popular in Japan, thus motivating Maxis to license it for US distribution as A-Train, available for DOS, Macintosh and Amiga platforms. It was released in October, 1992, though it sold poorly.
Even the release of an add-on pack for the game failed to stir up any real support amongst the gaming community. The game was the first major failure from Maxis.
In spite of the PC version's commercial failure in the US, Maxis later released a PlayStation version in 1996, based on Artdink's AIV: Evolution Global. The PlayStation was a relatively new platform at that point and the game suffered many limitations, such as requiring an entire memory card (expensive at the time) to store a single map. Like the PC version, it proved unsuccessful.


== Economic Model ==
A-Train contains a very challenging economic system that includes a 5% land tax on all property owned, and a 50% income tax. The economic model however fails to capture realistic land prices, which adds a major flaw to the games design. Certain buildings the AI is not allowed to build, such as the Amusement Park, Golf Course, and stadium. These buildings cost a relatively similar price no matter where they are placed, however, if placed in a thriving city, they can be sold for up to $6mil. This bug completely circumvents the difficulty inherent in the highly restrictive economic model.


== Sequels ==
In later years, development of the series continued on both console and PC platforms. A5, released for PlayStation and PC in 1997, introduced a totally 3D environment. A6, the first game in the series for PlayStation 2, was released in Japan in 2000 and later translated to English and released in Europe as A6: A-Train 6 by Midas Interactive Entertainment in 2004. A Ressha de Ikou 2001, a new version of A6 with online support, was released for PS2 in 2001 and followed by several expansion packs.
The most recently released game in the core series, A7, was released in 2005 for Windows-based PCs in Japanese. A Traditional Chinese translation was released in July 2006. However, the Chinese version does not include the original Japanese train, and some unrealistic fiction trains are added. A7 is advertised as an homage to the 10th anniversary of AIV and uses a trimetric interface, instead of the open 3D interface of A5 and A6.


== Reception ==

Computer Gaming World's reviewer Stanley Trevena stated in 1992 that while he enjoyed the financial and management aspects of A-Train, "many people will miss out on a fine program because of a steeply graded learning curve".
The game was reviewed in 1992 in Dragon #187 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. In 1993 the game received a Codie award from the Software Publishers Association for Best Strategy Program. A-Train's isometric, tile-based graphics and animated elements inspired the visual style Maxis went on to adopt for Simcity 2000 in 1993.
In 1994, PC Gamer UK named A-Train III the 46th best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, "Fascinating, absorbing and now quite cheap, A-Train is worth a place in any games collection — and don't be put off by the subject matter. It's brilliant fun."

=== A-Trak ===
Alain Macklovitch (born March 30, 1982), known professionally as A-Trak, is a Canadian DJ, record producer, and record executive. He came to prominence in the late 2000s as an international club DJ and remix artist, known for incorporating highly technical turntable skills and scratching into his genre-spanning work. He is also president of the record label Fool's Gold, which was founded in 2007, and is credited for developing the careers of artists such as Kid Cudi, Danny Brown, and Flosstradamus. Among other collaborative projects, he is part of the DJ duo Duck Sauce with Armand Van Helden and was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for their song "Barbra Streisand".
A-Trak's professional career has spanned over two decades and is built off his early success as a World Champion turntablist as well as Kanye West's original tour DJ. He was named one of the 50 Most Important People in EDM by Rolling Stone and has been called the Global Ambassador of DJ Culture, appearing on the covers of Billboard and Complex magazines.


== Early life ==
Alain Macklovitch was born on March 30, 1982, in Montreal, and was raised in the borough of Outremont. His mother Lison, was a professional translator of Moroccan Jewish descent, while his father Elliot Macklovitch was a professor of linguistics and machine language researcher of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. His older brother, David "Dave 1" Macklovitch, is one-half of the electro-funk duo Chromeo.  While his family was 'casually Jewish,' Macklovitch had a bar mitzvah. When he was 18 years old, his mother took him and his brother to Morocco to connect with their roots. In the early 2000s, he studied physics part-time at McGill University.
A-Trak began his interest in music around the age of ten, listening to Beastie Boys, Cypress Hill, and other early 1990s hip hop artists on cassettes his brother would bring home. Wanting to find his own instrument to create music on, he experimented with scratching records on his parents' turntable and quickly became fixated on becoming a good turntablist, finding mentors in local Montreal DJs Kid Koala and DJ Devious.


== Career ==


=== 1997–2002: Champion scratch DJ ===
A-Trak rapidly rose to prominence when he won the DMC World DJ Championship in 1997 at the age of 15, making him the youngest and first Canadian winner of the competition. A-Trak, who had been involved in the Montreal turntable and hip hop scene for a year or so at this point, was hailed by the international community as a highly technical and accomplished turntablist during the height of the scratch DJing in the 1990s. Between 1997 and 2000, he competed as a DJ internationally. A-Trak was the first DJ to win all three major DJ competition titles (DMC, ITF and Vestax), as well as the first DJ to win five World Championships. While he retired from competition in 2000, he continued to showcase his turntable skills in important DJ forums. A-Trak played the first Coachella Music Festival in 1999.

Also in 1997, A-Trak and his brother Dave, along with creative director Willo Perron, founded the Montreal-based record label Audio Research. Audio Research released a series of turntable and hip hop records and compilations, mostly as 12" records. The label was officially dissolved in 2011. In the late 1990s A-Trak developed a notation system for scratching. He gave a lecture about it at the Skratchcon 2000 conference and published an article in Tablist Magazine.


==== Obscure Disorder and DJ crews ====
In 1995, A-Trak, with brother Dave 1 and hip hop artists Troy Dunnit, Eclipse, and Logik, formed the hip hop crew Obscure Disorder as an after-school project. The group was part of the Montreal underground hip hop scene in that late 1990s and began releasing their music through Audio Research Records in 1997. The group released a series of singles until they split up in 2002.
A-Trak was an honorary member of the pioneering, and now defunct, DJ crew Invisibl Skratch Piklz. He was also a member of the DJ crew The Allies alongside frequent collaborator DJ Craze, as well as DVLP, Infamous, Spictakular, and J-Smoke; they released an album D-Day in 2000. The crew performed as a competitive turntable team from around 1998 until 2000.


=== 2002–2007: Touring DJ ===
After leaving the competitive DJ scene, A-Trak was interested in DJing for touring artists. A-Trak deejayed at clubs and festivals and released DJ mixes. In Spring 2006, A-Trak embarked on his first headline tour, titled the Sunglasses Is A Must Tour. It was also around this time that A-Trak began more seriously producing music.


==== Work with Kanye West ====
In 2004, Kanye West recruited A-Trak as his tour DJ. They first met earlier that year when A-Trak was playing a show at a tiny record shop in London where Kanye West came to support John Legend who was also playing in the same show. For the following three years, A-Trak worked closely with West, including at performances alongside the rapper at MTV specials, the Grammy Awards, multiple MTV Video Music Awards, and worldwide stadium shows; this included West's first two headlining tours which ran almost continuously from March 2004 until April 2006. A-Trak also recorded scratches on West's second and third studio albums Late Registration (2005) and Graduation (2007) and was an influence on the overall sound of the latter. A-Trak's most notable Kanye West credit is for the scratches on the 2005 single "Gold Digger." Near the end of 2007, A-Trak split with Kanye West to pursue the founding of his record label.


=== 2007–2014: Rise to the mainstream ===
After leaving behind his more backstage role as a touring turntablist, A-Trak would become one of the poster boys of the electronic dance music boom of the late 2000s/early 2010s, both due to his original music and highly popular remixes, as well as his keen curation sense and prowess as a music executive of his successful label. Since 2010, he has been a fixture on the international EDM music festival circuit and has noted that he is one of the few popular DJs who uses turntables and scratching in his live sets.
In 2012, A-Trak was featured on the cover of Billboard Magazine alongside Diplo and Skrillex; during this period he also appeared on the covers of other magazines including URB (twice), BPM, and Status.


==== Original music and remixes ====
In 2007, A-Trak released popular remixes of Architecture in Helsinki's "Heart It Races," Scanners' "Bombs," and Digitalism's "Idealistic," among others. He sometimes releases his bootlegs and remixes under his alias Trizzy. He also released the original singles "Say Whoa" on the French label Kitsuné. In 2008, A-Trak collaborated with Nike to create the 'soundtrack' Running Man: Nike+ Original Run; as part of his collaboration with Nike he also released the singles "Mastered (Me & My Sneakers)" featuring Lupe Fiasco and "Running Man." That year, he also collaborated with Laidback Luke for the first time, releasing the single "Shake It Down" and co-produced the track" Like The Dancefloor" featuring Natalie Storm with DJ Zinc. One of A-Trak's prominent remixes, a mix of Boys Noize's "Oh!," was also released in 2008.
In 2009, A-Trak released his full-length album DJ mix Infinity + 1. The follow-up record as a solo artists was 2012's Tuna Melt EP, released by Fool's Gold. The video for "Tuna Melt" was nominated in the Best Cinematography category at the MTV Video Music Awards.
Notable releases by A-Trak between these two records include "Ray Ban Vision" featuring CyHi Da Prince (2010), "Warrior" with Mark Foster and Kimbra for Converse's 3 Artists, 1 Song project (2012), "Money Makin'" with Dillon Francis (2012), and remixes of Daft Punk's "Robot Rock" (2009), Sébastien Tellier's "Kilometer" (2009), Justice's "D.A.N.C.E." (2010), The Rapture's "How Deep Is Your Love" (2011), and Surkin's "Never Let Go" (2012). On June 8, 2010, A-Trak released his wildly successful remix of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' track "Heads Will Roll", which was also featured on the Project X soundtrack.
In 2013, collaborated with GTA, Laidback Luke, and Oliver, and released popular remixes of Phoenix's "Trying to Be Cool" and Odd Look by Kavinsky. In February 2013, A-Trak released the video for his "Piss Test" remix off of the Fool's Gold album. The video features appearances by Jim Jones, Juicy J, A$AP Ferg, El-P, Flatbush Zombies, and Flosstradamus and was directed by Shomi Patwary.
In 2008, A-Trak played a series of high-profile music festivals including Coachella and Glastonbury. He had sets at Primavera Sound, Lollapalooza, and Parklife in Australia the following year. He also headlined his 10,000LB Hamburger Tour and a series of Bacardi B-Live sets. In February 2010, it was announced that A-Trak would perform live shows with Travis Barker, who had previously worked with their mutual friend, the late DJ AM. That year, he also played many EDM music festivals including Ultra, Electric Daisy Carnival, and Electric Zoo. The following decade, A-Trak continually at prominent music festivals and clubs. In 2011, he embarked on another headline tour, The Magic 8 Ball Tour and played again at Coachella. In 2012, he deejayed at Ultra and Electric Zoo and at similar festivals the following two year.


==== Fool's Gold founding ====
After moving to Williamsburg, he founded the label Fool's Gold Records with Nick Catchdubs and artist Dust La Rock in 2007. A-Trak and Catchdubs, both DJs, curated a multi-genre roster and have been integral in supporting the rise of many prominent hip hop and electronic artists. A-Trak has said he does not make a salary from the label and instead says its most important function for him is as a creative conduit. Since 2010, A-Trak has been performing at Fool's Gold's Day Off events, which occur about four times a year.
In 2011, A-Trak launched Fool's Gold Radio on the SiriusXM station Electric Area. The show continued for a few years. Also, in 2011, A-Trak opened a shop named Fool's Gold in Williamsburg. The shop closed in early 2017 and reopened on May 20 of the same year at a larger location nearby.


==== Duck Sauce ====
In 2009, A-Trak collaborated with Armand Van Helden to form a disco house production duo under the name Duck Sauce. They released the song "Anyway" in October on Ministry of Sound. Duck Sauce has achieved success worldwide including reaching the top chart position in twelve countries and attaining the #1 spot on the US Dance Billboard charts for their song "Barbra Streisand". "Big Bad Wolf" was released by Duck Sauce in 2011 on BBC Radio and samples wolves howling.
Following the announcement of a debut album, Duck Sauce released the singles "It's You" and "Radio Stereo". They released their first album, 'Quack', in 2014. Duck Sauce has been on the cover of DJ Mag twice, most recently in March 2020. In 2020, they also returned with two new singles, the first since 2014, "Smiley Face" and "Captain Duck".


=== 2014–present: New collaborations and ventures ===
Since the EDM explosion brought A-Trak to the forefront of electronic music in the 2010s, he has continued to evolve and innovate as both a producer and music executive, securing his position "of elder statesman of the culture." From the early 2010s to presently, A-Trak has been a fixture on the international electronic music festival scene. In August 2019, A-Trak joined the board of managers at Beatsource as an advisor. The company is the largest record promotion pool in the U.S. and serves the open-format DJ community with curated music from worldwide labels. He is also an investor and minority partner in Montreal-based imprint SAINTWOODS, which operates venues, a marketing agency and a clothing line.


==== New collaborations ====
Coming off a series of releases with Duck Sauce, A-Trak continued to collaborate with other artists, especially artists on Fool's Gold. In January 2014, A-Trak teamed up with Cadillac in a campaign to introduce their new logo and the 2015 ATS Coup. On November 25, 2014, A-Trak released his Push EP, featuring his single "Push", (featuring Andrew Wyatt). The song was included in FIFA 15 and received a companion remix album featuring remixes from The Chainsmokers, Cazzette, René LaVice, DallasK, among others, in 2015.
A-Trak received much publicity and released a string of singles in 2015. These included his remix of Alesso's song "Cool" and his single "We All Fall Down" (featuring Jamie Lidell), as well as remixes by Volt & State, CID and Jarreau Vandal. A-Trak was featured on Zhu's 2015 EP Genesis Series for his track "As Crazy as It Is" and was also featured on Disclosure's Magnets [The Remixes] EP, for his remix of "Magnets" (featuring Lorde). At the end of the year, A-Trak's "Place on Earth" single with ZooFunktion was released on Spinnin' Records.
A-Trak was featured on the 2016 Fool's Gold Records compilation album Fool's Gold Presents: Night Shift, for his song "Only One" with Ookay. On May 3, 2016, A-Trak premiered his single "Parallel Lines" (featuring Phantogram) on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 Radio show. A-Trak embarked on an Australian Tour with fellow producer What So Not on June 30, 2016. With Kanye West and Lex Luger, he also co-produced the song "Champions".
In 2017, A-Trak released "Believe" featuring Quavo and Lil Yachty, collaborated with Baauer for two singles, "Fern Gully" and "Dumbo Drop," and produced the song "Kitana" for Princess Nokia. He was also featured on tracks by Calvin Harris and The Cool Kids. In 2018, the single "Ride for Me" was released as a collaboration by A-Trak, Falcons, Young Thug and 24hrs via A-Trak's record label Fool's Gold.
In 2019, A-Trak released two singles, the disco-house track "Work It Out" in April and the Loods collaboration "What Can I Do" later that year, as well as a handful of VIP reworks on his recent A-Trak Bootleg Series, an informal collection of free releases he's made for his DJ sets. It was rumored that the producer was to release larger collection of music later in 2019 or in 2020.
In 2020, he began formally collaborating with his brother Dave 1 under the moniker The Brothers Macklovitch. They released two original singles that year, "Give Love to Get Some" and "I Can Call You."


==== Expansion of Fool's Gold ====
A-Trak's label began growing and his duties for it with it. Additionally, he began his own weekly two-hour radio show on Beats 1, listened to via Apple Music Connect, named Day Off Radio on July 4, 2015.


==== Goldie Awards ====
A-Trak helped to found a new DJ award in 2017 called the Goldie Awards. His hope is to create a new forum for DJ battles and contemporary scratch DJing. The annual awards competition takes place in New York every year and A-Trak is an integral part of the affair.


== Sound and equipment ==
Over the years, A-Trak has endorsed several brands including Serato Scratch Live and Rane DJ equipment. He was the first artist to ever endorse Serato and influenced many other DJs to use the software.
He is known for merging the sounds of rap and electronic music through his remix work, his 2007 CD Dirty South Dance, his production for Kid Sister and Lupe Fiasco, and his remixes for electronic artists including MSTRKRFT and Boys Noize. However, some of his production displays a separation of his electronic and hip hop identities, with releases such as "Piss Test" featuring Juicy J and collaborations with Tommy Trash on "Tuna Melt". Another hip hop production, "Ray Ban Vision", was used in the 2012 movie Project X.


== Personal life ==
After residing in Brooklyn for many years, Macklovitch moved to Los Angeles in late 2014.


== Awards ==
A-Trak was the 1999 YTV Achievement Awards Special Performance winner. In 2011, he was nominated for a Grammy Award alongside co-producer Armand Van Helden for their production and mixing of the track "Barbra Streisand". In 2012, Duck Sauce's "Big Bad Wolf" was nominated for a VMA for Best Electronic Dance video. In 2013, A-Trak's video for "Tuna Melt" was nominated in the Best Cinematography category at the MTV Video Music Awards. In 2017, A-Trak was nominated for DJ of the Year at the Electronic Music Awards. In 2018, he won Regional Open Format Club DJ of The Year (Northeast) at the Global Spin Awards.

=== A-Trane ===
The A-Trane is a jazz club in Berlin, Germany.


== Overview ==
The A-Trane was opened in late 1992. It is located in Berlin-Charlottenburg at Bleibtreustrasse 1 where its doors open every night at 9 pm. Uncounted locally and internationally renowned musicians have played the club, including Wynton Marsalis, Herbie Hancock, Lee Konitz, Brad Mehldau, Larry Coryell, Diana Krall, Esbjörn Svensson, James Carter, Detroit Gary Wiggins, Take 6 and Till Brönner. It is one of the venues of the annual JazzFest Berlin. Numerous live jazz albums have been recorded at the A-Trane. On Saturday nights after the regular show there is "Jazz after Midnight", the weekly jam session. The club can accommodate no more than 100 people that gather around the 12 square meter bandstand.
Since 1997, the club's owner and manager is the former designer/illustrator and professional basketball player Sedal Sardan, who regularly acts as MC. The club was named after John Coltrane (nicknamed "Trane") with a nod to the Billy Strayhorn standard "Take the A-Train" associated with Duke Ellington.
The A-Trane is widely considered one of Europe's most important jazz clubs and was honoured with the Live Entertainment Award (LEA) in the category "Best German Jazzclub" in April 2011.

=== A-Treat Bottling Company ===
The A-Treat Bottling Company was a beverage company headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, that manufactured and bottled the A-Treat brand of carbonated soft drinks. A-Treat stopped production on January 23, 2015, but the brand was purchased by Jaindl Companies and production resumed.


== History ==


=== 20th century ===
A-Treat was founded by the Munjones.  Their father, James J. Munjone, (June 1, 1887 - Jul 4, 1936
Naples, Italy) started a beverage business in the family home in the 600 block of Front Street in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and later built a small manufacturing facility behind the home.  When James passed away ownership was given to his sister,  Vincenza Munjone who was married to Gioacchino Egizio. The Egizio family took over the business from the Munjone's and the details of how that transaction occurred are not documented.
In 1932, the Egizio brothers moved the business to Union Boulevard in East Allentown, where it remains to this day.  Joseph C. Egizio served as the board chairman of A-Treat Bottling Co. until retiring in 1989.  He died in 2000, at the age of 96.  John L. Egizio, who had started working at the company at the age of 13 delivering sodas on his bicycle, served as vice president and co-owner until his death in 1990.
In 1991, the company was the subject of regional news coverage when a smear campaign was launched against A-Treat as it tried to sell its sodas in New York City.  The campaign, which targeted African Americans, claimed certain brands of carbonated beverages, including those produced by A-Treat, were actually manufactured by the Ku Klux Klan and contained stimulants that would "sterilize the black man". Investigations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the New York City Department of Health found the claims to be unsubstantiated and untrue.


=== 21st century ===
On July 21, 2015, it was announced that the Jaindl Companies had purchased the A-Treat brand, including its name, trademarks, formulas, and related intellectual property.  A co-packing agreement was reached with The Coca-Cola Company that keeps production in the Lehigh Valley, with production scheduled to resume in August 2015. A poll was held on July 27, 2015, to decide the first flavors A-Treat would release onto store shelves. With an unexpected victory, Orange Cream placed first with 17% of the votes, which was later revealed that the poll was manipulated by a single person using multi-login on Google Chrome to cast over 10,000 votes. Black Cherry placed second with 8% of votes, and production of the two flavors was immediately started alongside the eight previously announced flavors: Birch Beer, Cream, Big Blue, Ginger Ale, Sarsaparilla, Orange, Root Beer, Grapefruit, and Diet Cream. A-Treat Grapefruit, another flavor with a devoted following, was the first soda to roll off the line when A-Treat made its return in 2015.
On May 20, 2016, A-Treat launched Orange Cream, its first new flavor in over six years.


== Products ==
The company formerly distinguished itself by producing sodas in the traditional manner (e.g., using essential oils and cane sugar, rather than extracts and high fructose corn syrup). As of the final production, the company used both cane sugar syrup and high fructose corn syrup. A-Treat produced soft drinks in at least 16 flavors, including Big Blue (blue raspberry), Birch Beer, Black Cherry, Champagne Kola, Cola, Cream soda, Fruit Punch, two kinds of Ginger Ale (Pale Dry and Golden, formerly Peppery Golden), Grape, Grapefruit, White Birch Beer, Pineapple, Sarsaparilla, two kinds of Orange (regular and Orange Dry), Lime (formerly Tom Collins Mixer), Tonic Water (formerly Quinine Water), Strawberry, Treat-up, and Root Beer.  Most, if not all, of these flavors were also produced in a diet formulation. A-Treat Birch Beer and Sarsaparilla are rated highly by connoisseurs of these types of beverages.


== Distribution ==
A-Treat beverages are distributed in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, and Bermuda.

=== A-VSB ===
A-VSB or Advanced VSB is a modification of the 8VSB modulation system used for transmission of digital television using the ATSC system.  One of the constraints of conventional ATSC transmission is that reliable reception is difficult or impossible when the receiver is moving at speeds associated with normal vehicular traffic.  The technology was jointly developed by Samsung and Rohde & Schwarz.
A-VSB builds on the existing ATSC transmission standard to enhance DTV receivers’ ability to receive the main MPEG transport stream in dynamic environments. The system enables broadcasters to include multiple streams with additional error correction and time diversity encoding for enhanced reception. In addition, A-VSB facilitates synchronization of multiple transmission towers, which should improve coverage with higher uniform signal strength throughout a service area, even in locations that normally would be shielded by obstacles such as hills or buildings.
A-VSB incorporates three new elements: a Supplementary Reference Signal (SRS), a Scalable Turbo Stream (STS), and support for Single Frequency Networks (SFN).


== Supplementary Reference Signal ==
A-VSB receivers utilize the SRS in order to remain synchronized with the transmission. This helps maintain reception of the main stream and any turbo streams even with rapidly changing multipath interference, such as when the signal is reflected from moving objects near the receiver or when the receiver itself is moving.
The SRS adds an additional equalizer training sequence to the Transport Stream Adaptation Field, which should be ignored by existing transport decoders.  The added signal shortens the existing 24ms equalizer update time by a selectable factor, from 120x to 312x.  A receiver equipped with this new equalizer can track rapid multipath fading, and thus supports mobile reception. SRS can be used alone, without the STS, offering a slight improvement in portable (stationary—not true mobile) service.


== Scalable Turbo Stream ==
The addition of a new turbo-coded stream enables broadcasters to increase the error-correction capability of a secondary stream transmission.  Two options are proposed for the turbo stream: ½ and ¼ rate codes, i.e., the new video stream requires 2x or 4x the video rate in final transport payload. The new Threshold of Visibility (TOV) SNRs are 9.6 and 4.5 dB, respectively; 1.6dB is claimed with diversity reception. Conventional 8VSB has a TOV SNR of 15.1 dB. The turbo codec uses single-input single-output (SISO) iterative decoding and time interleaving.

=== A-WA ===
A-WA (pronounced [ˈeːwa], Arabic for Yes) is an Israeli band made up of the three sisters Tair, Liron, and Tagel Haim. Their single "Habib Galbi" (Love of My Heart) became a global hit, with its Yemenite traditional music mixed with hip hop and electronic music.


== Personal lives ==
The Haim sisters grew up in the community settlement of Shaharut, a village of about thirty families in the Arava Valley desert of southern Israel, to a father of Yemenite Jewish origin and a mother of mixed Ukrainian and Moroccan Jewish heritage. Their paternal grandparents are originally from Sana'a and were brought to Israel during Operation Magic Carpet.
The Haim sisters spent most of their holidays with their paternal grandparents, singing piyyutim, traditional liturgical poems in Hebrew and Aramaic, as well as traditional Yemenite songs in Arabic sung by women. Their parents also played a variety of music genres in their house, with their father playing guitar, bouzouki, and darbuka. At school, the sister took voice, piano, theater, and dance lessons.
Tair has a BA in music from Levinsky College of Education in Tel Aviv, while Liron is an architect, and Tagel is a graphic designer and illustrator. They also have two younger sisters, Shir and Tzlil, and a brother, Evyatar, who is a sound technician and was involved in the production of the album Habib Galbi.


== Musical career ==
A-WA first formed in 2011, after the trio finished college, and they began uploading music to YouTube.

The trio was discovered by Tomer Yosef, the lead singer of Balkan Beat Box, to whom they sent a demo of "Habib Galbi", a traditional Yemenite melody sung in the Yemenite dialect of Judeo-Arabic. He showed the demo to a few elder Yemenite women, who mistook the sisters for actual singers from Yemen. The music video, released in early March, went viral in the Muslim world, especially in Yemen. The three officially released the single in April 2015, and it became the first song in Arabic to hit number 1 on the Israeli pop charts. They toured in Europe after the single's release. The trio debuted the other songs from their debut album during performances in September 2015. The record itself was released in 2016. 
A-WA's second studio album, Bayti Fi Rasi, was released in 2019. It is inspired by their great-grandmother Rachel's experiences when immigrating to Israel from Yemen as a single mother and subsequent life in a transition camp. The trio directed a music video for one of the album's songs, "Hana Mash Hu Al Yaman". That same year, the group was invited to perform at the torch-lighting ceremony on Israel's independence day. In September 2019, A-WA was invited to play a Tiny Desk Concert at NPR's headquarters in Washington, D.C. Throughout the end of the year, they toured in Europe and the United States.
In early 2020, Tair released a solo single, titled "Mitbashelet Leat".


== Musical style ==
During their childhood, the three sisters listened to many different kinds of music, including Greek, jazz, R&B, hip hop, reggae, and progressive rock, but their major source of inspiration has been the traditional Yemenite songs heard at their paternal grandparents' home. Their music follows the same trend as did Ofra Haza, their main inspiration, decades ago, mixing in this case traditional Yemenite folk music with electronic tunes, reggae, and hip hop, which they call "yemenite folk n' beat".
The trio also cites psychedelic rock, including Deep Purple and Pink Floyd, as influential in their music.

=== A-YA ===
A-YA (A-JA), Cyrillic: a-Я — журнал неофициального русского искусства (English: Magazine of Unofficial Russian Art), was an underground Russian art revue. A-YA was illegally prepared in the Soviet Union and then published in Paris from 1979 to 1986.
The editors were Alexander Sidorov (under the pseudonym "Alexej Alexejev") in Moscow and Igor Shelkovsky in Paris. A-YA was distributed in the U.S. by Alexander Kosolapov in New York. It consisted of 60 pages in A4 format. There were 3000 copies per edition (the first edition numbered 7000). A-YA was printed in both color and black and white.
An informal magazine, A-YA opened to the world the virtually unknown-to-the-public contemporary Soviet art and current Russian art, which for many years was to dominate the world's leading exhibition venues and auctions. It was from A-YA that people first heard the names Eric Bulatov, Ilya Kabakov, Dmitry Prigov and many others.
In 2004, the entire run was reprinted as one volume by ArtChronika with a new foreword by Shelkovsky as A-YA - Unofficial Russian Art Review: 1979-1986 (ISBN 9785902647010).

=== A-Yo (Lady Gaga song) ===
"A-Yo" is a song recorded by American singer Lady Gaga for her fifth studio album, Joanne (2016). It was released to Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show on October 18, 2016, as the record's second promotional single by Interscope Records. Gaga co-wrote and co-produced the song with Mark Ronson and BloodPop, with Hillary Lindsey being the additional songwriter. A funky, electro-tinged and rock-inspired upbeat country pop track, "A-Yo" lyrically delves on leaving behind haters.
Critical reception towards "A-Yo" was positive and the song entered the record charts of multiple countries, including reaching a peak of number 66 on United States' Billboard Hot 100. To promote the track's release, Gaga performed it on concert venues of her Dive Bar Tour and on television shows. It was later added to her set list at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016, the 2017 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Joanne World Tour (2017–2018).


== Background and release ==
Following the release of "Perfect Illusion", the lead single from her fifth studio album Joanne, on September 9, 2016, Lady Gaga announced the Dive Bar Tour, a promotional concert series where the singer performed at various dive bars in the United States. The venues for the concert series remained undisclosed to have a more intimate approach. The campaign was sponsored by Bud Light, and premiered on October 5, 2016. Simultaneously, a live broadcast of the event was streamed on Bud Light's official Facebook page. On October 2, 2016, several publications claimed that during the first show of the tour, new songs would be sung.
Singer-songwriter Hillary Lindsey, who previously had experiences in writing country songs in Nashville, was identified by Interscope Records as a potential collaborator on Joanne. The label's A&R Aaron Bay-Schuck, who had heard the initial Joanne material, introduced Gaga and Lindsey. During the Dive Bar Tour, Gaga recalled that she and Lindsey were seated in couches and having a back-and-forth conversation with guitar and piano. They bonded over drinks and Gaga also played initial demos of some of the tracks she had written. Lindsey remembered that Gaga's personal experiences and stories resulted in many ideas for songs, including "A-Yo". On her Twitter account, Gaga clarified that the track was about different things like cigarettes, one's enemies as well as having sex, expanding with the message: "Leavin ur haters in the dust is a sexy feelin, drag em' like a smoke, leave ur blazin' tracks in the road #AYO".
"A-Yo" was originally planned as the album's second single, but another track, "Million Reasons", was chosen due to the latter's commercial success. "A-Yo" premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show on October 18, 2016, and was made available for digital download and streaming. She posted a link to the song on her Twitter account, while responding to Alex Pall of The Chainsmokers's dismissal of "Perfect Illusion", writing "maybe u guys'll like this 1 better  [sic]". The single's cover art features Gaga topless and covering her chest with her hand, wearing a feathered hat that hides her eyes.


== Recording and composition ==
"A-Yo" was written and produced by Gaga with Mark Ronson and BloodPop, with Lindsey as an additional co-writer. It was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City by Benjamin Rice who was assisted by Barry McCready. Joshua Blair continued the additional recording for the track at Shangri-La Studios, Malibu, California with David "Squirrel" Covell, and also at Pink Duck Studios in Burbank, California, assisted by Justin Smith. The mixing for "A-Yo" was performed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios, Virginia Beach, Virginia, with engineering for the mix by Josh Hanes. Other instrumentation for "A-Yo" included guitars and percussion by Gaga, bass and guitars by Mark Ronson, and synthesizer and organ by BloodPop. Tom Coyne and Randy Merrill completed the audio mastering at Sterling Sound Studios in New York City.
"A-Yo" is a funky, "electro-tinged" and "rock-inspired" song. Yahoo! described "A-Yo as a country rock track. Rolling Stone described "A-Yo" as an upbeat country pop track. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, "A-Yo" is written in the key of A major in common time with a tempo of 150 beats per minute. The chords alternate between A7 and D7, and Gaga's vocals span two octaves from E3 to E5. Michelle Lulic from Bustle felt that the lyrics seem to describe "things getting hot-and-heavy in her car": "I can't wait to rev you up /Faster than you can say "Ferrari" /Tearin' up the gravel, watching you unravel /Now it's a party". During the chorus, Gaga sings "A-Yo, A-Yo, we smokin' 'em all", emphasizing her explanation about "leaving your haters in the dust".


== Critical reception ==
Tricia Gilbride from Mashable called "A-Yo" "ridiculously catchy" and "a futuristic country-rock song egging you on to have a good time over guitar solos and digital beats". Bustle's Michelle Lulic noted that "this may just be one of Lady Gaga's most simplistic yet most visual songs yet" and thanks to its repetitive chorus, it was "near impossible not to start singing by the time you get to the end of your first listen of the song". Larry Bartleet of British magazine NME commented that "the transformation might grate on fans of Gaga's past few albums of pop, but from these lyrics it looks like on fifth album 'Joanne' she really doesn't care what people think". Andy Gill from The Independent complimented Josh Homme's "spiky but fluid breaks" on songs like "A-Yo" and "John Wayne", which were "undoubted album highlights". Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post said that "A-Yo" sounded like a cross between "Manicure" from Artpop and "Americano" from Born This Way, but with touches of country. He went on to compliment Gaga for pulling off "perfecly" her wish of Joanne having a "dive bar feel" with the song.
Stereogum's Chris DeVille wrote, "Despite its funky digital beat, rap-inflected hook, and playfully tweaked guitar twang, it might actually go over pretty well on country radio if enough programmers gave it a chance. That said, this computerized juke-joint party track is far from M.O.R. by Nashville standards". Carey O'Donnell from Paper magazine called it a "foot stomping, hand-clapping rock pop track", but said it sounded better live. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called the song "riotous". The New York Times's Jon Caramanica felt that "A-Yo" sounded like "a Britney Spears parody or a song drawn from one of those live musicals that have been littering network television" since Glee ended. Maeve McDermott of USA Today was negative, saying "songs that sound most like Gaga's earlier hits" like "A-Yo" were Joanne's weakest moments.


== Chart performance ==
In the United States, "A-Yo" reached number-one on the Billboard Twitter Real-Time chart following the release of Joanne. On the Billboard Hot 100 it debuted and peaked at number 66. On the Canadian Hot 100, "A-Yo" reached number 55. Similarly, in the United Kingdom the song reached number 66 on the UK Singles Chart, selling 8,332 equivalent units, and debuted with around the same numbers in Ireland and Scotland. Other European countries where the song debuted includes France, Portugal and Switzerland, and the digital charts of Czech Republic and Slovakia.
As of February 2020, the song has sold 5,500 digital downloads and acquired 6.47 million streams in the UK.


== Live performances ==

Gaga first performed "A-Yo" on the Dive Bar Tour, a brief three-date promotional tour of U.S. dive bars, with Mark Ronson accompanying her by playing guitar during her performance in The Bitter End (New York City) and The Satellite (Los Angeles). She performed "A-Yo" live on network television along with "Million Reasons", as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live dated October 22, 2016. For "A-Yo", Ronson again assisted Gaga by playing guitar, and the singer did a honky-tonk and go-go dancing inspired performance. Rolling Stone's Daniel Kreps described it as intense singing, with Gaga "feverishly dancing and wildly shredding on her guitar". Paste's Chris White called Gaga an "incredible performer and vocalist" based on the performances, adding that she "understands the stagecraft of playing live music on [the SNL stage]". Three days later, she appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden on CBS Television City studios, and delivered the opening monologue, while also performing "A-Yo". The same month she performed "A-Yo" during the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, while wearing a glittering, black catsuit.
Gaga next performed "A-Yo" during her set at the 2017 Coachella Festival. While singing she played a special guitar, which was in wireless connection with her phone, allowing her to change its colour during the performance. "A-Yo" was performed as the second song on the Joanne World Tour (2017–2018) shows, where she again played the guitar. She wore a black bejeweled fringe leotard and a crystallized hat for the performance.

=== A-Z West ===
A-Z West is an 80-acre compound and artwork by artist Andrea Zittel, located in the Mojave Desert in Joshua Tree, California. Zittel conceived of A-Z West as a project to explore psycho-social aspects of day-to-day living, "what it means to live," and functional systems for desert life. Zittel lived in A-Z West from 2000 to 2022. Artworks previously created by Zittel on the A-Z West compound include The Wagon Station Encampment, Regenerating Field (2002), and Planar Pavilions at A-Z West (2017).
In 2002, Zittel and a group of collaborators - Lisa Anne Auerbach, John Connelly, Shaun Caley-Regen and Andy Stillpass - formed High Desert Test Sites (HDTS). Zittel stayed as the primary producer and supervisor for two decades. The nonprofit High Desert Test Sites assumed the management and stewardship of the land and artworks around 2022, and currently runs residencies, educational workshops, and art exhibitions on and around A-Z West.
There are four original homestead cabins on the compound that Zittel converted into The A-Z West House, a library, a caretaker’s house, and additional dwelling units. The A-Z West House contains artworks based on Zittel’s idea of “life practice” - functional aesthetics for everyday living, from furniture to a chicken coop. Functional artworks in the home include Aggregated stacks, Linear sequence, and Hooks, energetic accumulators. Art writer Terry Myers discussed the philosophy of artist Robert Rauschenberg - known for exploring the space between art and life - as an inspiration to Zittel. Others have brought attention to Zittel's focus on the elemental aspects of life and environmental thinking,

Every part of Zittel’s environment, from the home she lives in to the clothes she wears and the bowls she eats from, is intentionally designed to align with a unique mode of existence that draws on Modernist utopianism, contemporary environmentalism and progressive self-sufficiency.
The A-Z West Studio was built in 2010-2011, and includes a ceramics workshop, wood shop, and weaving studio with seven floor looms, in addition to an office and the A-Z West Works Studio Store. A-Z West Works produces ceramics, textiles, and clothing products at the A-Z West Studio.


== History ==
A-Z West was a continuation of the model established by A-Z East in Brooklyn, NY.  A-Z East originated as a 200 square foot storefront at 72 S. 8th St. in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where Zittel first began experimenting with living structures and started to gain recognition for the A-Z project. In 1994, the project moved to 150 Wythe Ave. in Brooklyn, a 3 story row house, which Zittel turned into a showroom testing grounds for her experimental structures for living, opening to the public for weekly viewings, while she continued to live in it. 
In 1999-2000, Zittel moved to Joshua Tree and purchased a 5 acre parcel that slowly grew to the 80 acre A-Z West compound. 
From 2018-2020, A-Z West also included a satellite project in Wonder Valley, California with two homestead cabins, The Experimental Living Cabins.

=== A-Z of Rude Health ===
A-Z of Rude Health  was a medical series taking a lighthearted look at sexual health. For every letter of the alphabet, a topic of sexual health was covered. e.g. A for Anal, B for Balls, C for Chlyamydia etc. The factual but lighthearted studio segments were presented in a semi-improvised format by Dr Phil Hammond and Dr Annie Evans after scripting discussions between the presenters and Mr Peter Greenhouse, while all three worked together at the Bristol Department of Sexual Health, and the vox pops and comedy pieces were written and performed by Kev F Sutherland. It was broadcast late on Friday night on regional ITV in the Bristol and West area.
The same production team, at HTV in Bristol, went on to produce the first TV series of The Sitcom Trials, also for ITV.

=== A- and B-class destroyer ===
The A- and B-class destroyers were a group of 18 destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the late 1920s, with two additional ships built for the Royal Canadian Navy. The British ships were divided into two flotillas of eight destroyers, each with a flotilla leader.


== Design and description ==
The A-class design was derived from the 1926 prototypes Amazon and Ambuscade for the 1927–28 Naval Construction Programme. The initial staff requirements were unrealistic and would have resulted in a much larger, unaffordable ship; they were scaled back, both to reduce the size of the ship and to save money. Nonetheless, the design had an improved gun armament, heavier torpedo armament, and greater range, at the cost of 2 knots (3.7 km/h; 2.3 mph) of speed, in comparison with the prototypes. The As were fitted with the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear and only had a residual anti-submarine ability while the Bs were equipped with Type 119 ASDIC (sonar) and had a full complement of depth charges, but could not use the TSDS. This was the beginning of the Admiralty's policy of alternating TSDS and anti-submarine capabilities between destroyer flotillas. The ships displaced 1,350–1,360 long tons (1,370–1,380 t) at standard load and 1,778–1,790 long tons (1,807–1,819 t) at deep load. They had an overall length of 323 feet (98.5 m), a beam of 32 feet 3 inches (9.8 m) and a draught of 12 feet 3 inches (3.7 m). The A class had a metacentric height of 1.76 feet (0.54 m) at deep load. The ships' complement was 138 officers and ratings as built, but increased in size up to 162 during the war.
The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three water-tube boilers equipped with superheaters. Five of the As and all of the Bs had Admiralty three-drum boilers that operated at a pressure of 300 pounds per square inch (2,068 kPa; 21 kgf/cm2) and a temperature of 600 °F (316 °C) while Ardent and Anthony were fitted with Yarrow boilers of 275 psi (1,896 kPa; 19 kgf/cm2) pressure at the same temperature. Acheron was given experimental Thornycroft boilers that had a working pressure of 500 psi (3,447 kPa; 35 kgf/cm2) and a temperature of 750 °F (399 °C) to examine the weight and economy savings. Her specific fuel consumption was reduced from 0.8 lb (0.36 kg)/hp/hour in her sisters to 0.6 lb (0.27 kg)/hp/hour, although she was plagued by mechanical problems for her whole life. In the event the trials were inconclusive, and the Admiralty continued to use the lower-temperature and pressure Admiralty three-drum boiler until the Battle class of 1942, nearly ten years after other major navies began to use higher-pressure and temperature boilers. The turbines developed a total of 34,000 shaft horsepower (25,000 kW) for a designed speed of 35 knots (65 km/h; 40 mph) and the ship exceeded that during their sea trials. The destroyers carried a maximum of 388–390 long tons (394–396 t) of fuel oil that gave them a range of 4,800 nautical miles (8,900 km; 5,500 mi) at 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph).
All of the ships had the same main armament, four quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts with enlarged gun shields, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. Although the A class were intended to be equipped with gun mounts that could elevate up to 40°, and 'B' gun on a high-angle mount capable of 60°, all four guns ultimately had a maximum elevation of 30°. They fired a 50-pound (23 kg) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2,650 ft/s (810 m/s) to a range of 16,970 yards (15,520 m). Each gun was provided with 190 rounds. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, the A- and B-class ships carried two 40-millimetre (1.6 in) QF two-pounder Mark II AA guns mounted on platforms between the funnels, each with 500 rounds. They were fitted with two quadruple mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The A-class ships were initially going to be fitted with two throwers and four chutes for eight depth charges, but they interfered with the TSDS equipment so the throwers, one chute and two depth charges were removed. The Bs were equipped with two throwers and one rack for twenty depth charges. While not initially fitted with ASDIC, space was reserved for it, and at least some of the As received it beginning in the late 1930s.
The fire-control system for these ships was little advanced over their First World War-era predecessors. A pedestal-mounted, manually operated Destroyer Director Sight and a separate nine-foot (2.7 m) rangefinder positioned to its rear were situated above the bridge; the director transmitted training angles and firing impulses to the main guns, which fired at fixed elevations. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye. No fire-control computer was initially installed, but an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mark II was retrofitted after it had been proven in the subsequent C-class destroyers.


=== Canadian ships ===
The two Canadian ships (Saguenay and Skeena) were designed to be of a similar performance to the A-class ships to allow them to tactically combine. More flare was given to the bow to keep it drier and the forward part of the hull was strengthened to withstand ice. Their metacentric height was increased to allow for the build-up of ice and snow on the upperworks and they were three feet (0.9 m) shorter than their British counterparts. Although the ships had an additional 50 long tons (51 t) of fuel, 2,000 shp (1,500 kW) fewer horsepower and lacked superheaters for their boilers, they had the same range and speed as their brethren of the A and B classes. They displaced 1,337 long tons (1,358 t) at standard load and 1,805 long tons (1,834 t) at deep load. The ships were built by John I. Thornycroft & Company in Woolston, Hampshire and had the broad, slab-sided funnels characteristic of that builder.


=== Flotilla leaders ===
Codrington was built to an enlarged design to accommodate the commander of the destroyer flotilla, Captain (D) and his staff, some 47 additional officers and ratings. The ship displaced roughly 200 long tons (200 t) more than the private ships (1,540 long tons (1,560 t) at standard load and 2,012 long tons (2,044 t) at deep load); she was 20 feet (6.1 m) longer overall and had a beam 1 foot (0.3 m) wider. She shipped a fifth 4.7-inch gun between the funnels, which forced the two-pounders to be repositioned abaft the rear funnel, and was not fitted with TSDS. To compensate for her greater size, Codrington's oil tanks were increased by 40 long tons (41 t) and her turbines were rated at 39,000 shp (29,000 kW) to give her the same range and speed as the private ships, but she proved to be significantly faster as she made 37.7 knots (69.8 km/h; 43.4 mph) during her sea trials. However, the increased length made her somewhat unhandy, having a turning circle much greater than the standard A class, which complicated manoeuvres with her flotilla.
Unlike Codrington, Keith was built upon the same hull as her sisters to save money and to make her tactically identical to her flotilla-mates. The initial proposal was to enlarge the aft deckhouse to make room for the Captain (D) and his staff at the expense of 'Y' gun and the TSDS gear, but the gun was reinstated while she was under construction. The ship was too small to accommodate the entirety of the staff, and Blanche was fitted as a divisional leader to carry the surplus. Keith was 40 long tons (41 t) heavier than the private ships at standard load and nearly 100 long tons (100 t) heavier at full load (1,400 long tons (1,400 t) and 1,821 long tons (1,850 t), respectively) and carried 19 additional officers and ratings.


=== Wartime modifications ===
The initial wartime modifications were limited and mostly related to the survivability of the crew, aside from the addition of 50 rounds per gun of 4.7-inch ammunition and the increase of depth charge stowage to 42 (the Canadian ships carried 33). Beginning in May 1940, the after bank of torpedo tubes was removed in most ships and replaced with a QF three-inch (76 mm) 20-cwt anti-aircraft gun, the after mast and funnel being cut down to improve the gun's field of fire. Of the early war losses, only Codrington and Acheron received this modification before they were sunk. By October, all of the surviving A-class ships plus Beagle, Boadicea, Boreas and Brilliant had been modified and the rest of the Bs had received theirs by April 1941.
Beginning in 1941, most ships had 'Y' gun and the TSDS gear replaced by racks and throwers for a pattern of 10 depth charges, with stowage increased to 70 charges. Their light AA armament was augmented by a pair of QF Oerlikon 20-millimetre (0.79 in) guns, one each abreast the bridge, and a Type 286 short-range, surface-search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. The Canadian ships replaced their two-pounders with a pair of quadruple 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) machine guns and were not fitted with Oerlikons by 1942.
Late that year, some of the surviving ships were further modified into what became known as escort destroyers. These ships had either 'A' or 'B' gun replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. Achates, Beagle, Boreas, and Bulldog were among the first ships to be so converted. Around this same time many ships had their Destroyer Director Sight and rangefinder exchanged for a Type 271 target-indication radar. Beagle and Bulldog were later fitted with a two-pounder bow chaser to engage German E-boats in the English Channel while Boadicea received two elderly six-pounder (57 mm) Hotchkiss guns to deal with U-boats on the surface at close range.
Beginning in 1943, the three-inch gun was removed to allow for the installation of a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast; the aft torpedo tubes were sometimes reinstalled. The single 20 mm guns abreast the bridge were replaced by Mark V powered mountings for twin weapons later in the war, the singles replacing the two-pounder or .50 caliber guns amidships, with a further pair of Oerlikons that replaced the searchlight between the torpedo tubes.

=== A-class ships ===


=== B-class ships ===


== Service ==
The class saw much service in the Second World War, being involved in convoy protection and anti-submarine warfare in home waters and the North Atlantic. Seven of the eleven ships of the class were sunk in World War II. Acasta and Ardent were sunk on 8 June 1940 while escorting the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious by the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau west of Narvik at the end of the Norwegian campaign. Codrington was sunk by German air attack at Dover on 27 July 1940. Acheron was sunk by a mine off the Isle of Wight on 17 December 1940. Achates was sunk by two large German heavy cruisers, Admiral Hipper and Lützow while defending an Arctic convoy in the Battle of the Barents Sea. Arrow was so badly damaged when the ammunition ship Fort La Montee blew up on 4 August 1943 at Algiers that she could not be repaired and was towed to Taranto and paid off. Skeena was wrecked in a storm off Iceland on 25 October 1944. Saguenay was heavily damaged in a collision with the merchant ship Azara and was consigned to the role of a training ship after being repaired.
The surviving ships were worn out from war duties and were scrapped soon after the war.

=== A-b-c-darian ===
A-B-C-darians, ABC-darians, or abecedarians were the youngest students (then called scholars) in the typical one-room school of 19th-century America. 
The name comes from its original purpose which was mainly restricted to learning the alphabet. It could also refer to someone teaching the alphabet. 


== Early references ==
In his autobiographical reminiscences on his school days, Warren Burton recounted that he "was three years and a half old when I first entered the Old School-house as an abecedarian".
Many young children were simply sent along with other siblings in order to get them out of their mothers' way. Noah Webster's early school dictionary contains the following entry for abecedarian:  A-be-ce-da'-ri-an, n. One who teaches or is learning the alphabet.


== Front row seats ==
In the district schools of the early 19th century, the youngest scholars were seated on the front benches in a room that typically had floors that sloped up from the center on three sides like a small amphitheater. The entrance door(s) and the teacher's desk were located on the unsloped side. The desks accommodated two or more scholars and were arranged up the ramps around a center space, the front of each desk providing the seat for the desk before it, with the front rows consisting only of the benches attached to the desks of the second row where the youngest children sat. Samuel Griswold Goodrich (a.k.a. "Peter Parley") attended a district school around 1810 in which "The larger scholars were ranged on the outer sides, at the desks; the smaller fry of a-b-c-darians were seated in the center".
Warren Burton also noted that "next to the spelling floor, were low, narrow seats for abecedarians and others near that rank. In general, the older the scholar the further from the front was his location".


== A day in the life of an a-b-c-darian ==
A-b-c-darians in unreformed schools were drilled in their letters two or three times a day, then spent the rest of the school day on their own trying to recall the names of letters, and probably watching the recitations of older scholars who were called to the middle of the room to show what they had learned for the schoolmaster. Educator William Augustus Mowry recalled that "I was sent to the old brick schoolhouse when I was four years old. Two or three others entered school at the same A-B-C time. We sat on the low seat facing the open Class floor—the boys on one side and the girls on the other. We had nothing to do but to look on and thus cultivate our powers of observation. With all the classes of an ungraded school to teach, of course the teacher could give but a few minutes to the three A-B-C darians, who had just entered the school. Twice a day we were called up and took our places at the teacher's knee. Here we received our first lessons in learning to read; and this reading lesson of five minutes in the forenoon and five minutes in the afternoon was all we had to do".


== Reform ==
Beginning in the 1830s, education reform included consideration of how to improve instruction for all students, including the a-b-c-darians. Education reformer Henry Barnard shared in the American Journal of Education that "Basedow  at Magdeburg Johann Bernhard Basedow, adopted a constructive method of teaching the letters, by presenting them made in gingerbread—then rewarding success in remembering the name by gift of the substance. This founder of Philanthropinism should be held in everlasting and grateful remembrance by A-b-c-darians".
In the 1850s it was reported that in some, modifications had already taken place: "The A B C darians are each in a separate class, and are instructed in a very uniform style".
By contrast, New York educators continued to complain of poor methods for the younger students into the 1860s. "The habit of requiring the children of the alphabet class to give formal definitions to words which are far more simple than those used to define them, is a practice which I have endeavored to discourage. For instance, such words as father, mother, brother, sister, boy, girl, etc., it is not uncommon to hear defined by these little A-B-C-darians, in this manner:—"Mother—a female parent; brother—a male child born of the same parents; girl—a female child; cat— a domestic animal; cow—a domestic animal", &c."


== Obsolescence ==
By the end of the 19th century, the mere use of the term represented a bygone era of the one-room schoolhouse. George Howland, superintendent of the Chicago Public Schools declared in 1898 that "The days of the A-B-C-darians, and the three R's—all! ah! and alas!—have happily gone by, and hard after them are following those to whom the ability to trace with index-finger, word by word, and line by line, the pupil's progress down the page of the text-book, was enough".

=== A-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha ===
Ivan Malkovych's Publishing House "A-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha" is a Ukrainian publishing house that was founded  in 1992, becoming the first private children's book publisher in independent Ukraine. It started to publish books for a wider range of readers in 2008. Ivan Malkovych is a founder, as well as director and the main editor. He controls the publishing of each and every book from its manuscript to the final printing process.


== History ==
The publishing house name derives from a phrase "a-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha" firstly used in Ivan Franko's short story Hrytseva shkilna nauka (Hryts's Schooling), whose main character learns how to read by syllables using the phrase "a-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha" (stands for A baba halamaha, which literally means And a grandma is a blabbermouth).
The publishing house for children from 2 to 102 presented its first title The Ukrainian Alphabet in July 1992. As Ivan Malkovych stated: "At first I didn't think of the publishing house, all I had in mind was an alphabet book starting with the word Angel. I didn't want it to be words like Autobus and Akula (Shark) or whatever on purpose. I wanted my book to start with the Angel."
A New York publishing house Alfred A. Knopf purchased a publication rights of the A-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha's children book The Kitten and the Rooster in 1995. It was the first time a notable Western publisher expressed its interest in a book of a Ukrainian publishing house.
Following the success in The Moscow International Book Fair in 2001, Malkovych decided to open a branch office in Russia, which was established in Moscow in 2004. The publishing house commenced publishing books in Russian, that were not to be distributed in Ukraine.
The new Ukrainian translation of Hamlet executed by Yuri Andrukhovych was published in 2008, for which the publishing house received a Grand Prix of Ukrainian contest The Best Book of The Lviv Publishers' Forum.
A-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha published more than 100 titles with a total circulation of more than 4,000,000 copies. It has also sold the publishing rights for its books to 19 foreign countries.
The director of A-ba-ba-ha-la-ma-ha Ivan Malkovych claimed that there was a failed raider attack on the publishing house's office in November 2011.


== Authors ==
A-Ba-Ba-Ga-La-Ma-Ga publishes prominent authors of the past and present, Ukrainian and foreign, in their own translation. Yuriy Andrukhovych, Mykola Vingranovsky, Lina Kostenko, Sashko Dermansky, Maryna and Serhiy Dyachenko, Andriy Kokotiukha, Vsevolod Nestayko, Dmytro Pavlychko, Volodymyr Rutkivsky, Oleksandr Havrosh, and Yuriy Vynnychuk have collaborated with the publishing house.
The translations of foreign authors for the publishing house were done by Yuriy Andrukhovych, Viktor Morozov, Roman Osadchuk, Yevhen Popovych, Yuriy Vynnychuk, and Valentyn Kornienko. Mrs. Yushchenko translated into English the book “Honey for Mom” by Ivan Malkovych and Sofia Us.

=== A-bike ===
The A-bike is a folding bicycle released by Sir Clive Sinclair in the United Kingdom on 12 July 2006. It was designed by Hong Kong design agency Daka, in collaboration with Sinclair Research, over a 5-year period. It was announced to the public in 2004. Clive Sinclair envisioned the A-bike, and Alex Kalogroulis was the main designer. It weighs 5.7 kg (13 lb) and folds to 67×30×16 cm (26.4×11.8×6.3 in), small enough to fit in a rucksack. The first version had 15 cm (6 in) wheels, which was increased to 20 cm (8 in) in later models. In 2015, an electric version, the A-Bike Electric, was introduced to the public as part of a Kickstarter campaign.

=== History ===
The A-bike was designed by Sinclair Research, in collaboration with Hong Kong design agency Daka, over a 5-year period. It was announced to the public in 2004. Clive Sinclair envisioned the A-bike, and Alex Kalogroulis was the main design engineer. It was released on 12 July 2006, and was priced at £199. The official Europe distributor, Mayhem UK, hoped to sell 25,000 units in the first 12 months. By 2007 it was being noted that a "large number of counterfeit" A-bikes were appearing in China and elsewhere.
Early reviews praised the A-bike for being lightweight and easy to fold, but noted the flexing frame and uncomfortable saddle, and criticised the tiny wheels for being unsafe on uneven roads.
In 2008 the Mark-II version was released: officially known as the A-Bike Plus. This version had strengthened aluminium tubing, a new air-sprung cushioned saddle, and an upgraded drive mechanism. The Mark-III version was released in 2010, and was officially known as the A-Bike City. The main changes were larger 20 cm (8 in) wheels and it was priced at £299.99.


=== Characteristics ===
The A-bike is a small wheel bicycle with 15 cm (6 in) wheels, increasing to 20 cm (8 in) in later models. The original model weighs 5.7 kg (13 lb), and folds to 67×30×16 cm (26.4×11.8×6.3 in) reducing its volume to about 25% of its original size. A twin-chain system enables the bike to travel about 3.2 m (10.5 ft) per crank rotation despite the bicycle's small-diameter wheels (15 cm (6 in)). The crankcase housing almost completely encloses the drive mechanism, protecting it and preventing oil stains on clothing or floor surfaces.


=== Media appearances ===
In November 2006, A-bike was featured on UK television programme The Gadget Show, alongside the Strida.  The distribution company behind the A-bike was featured on the UK Television programme Badger or Bust broadcast on 5 June 2007. In the Top Gear epic race Car vs. Train 2. Richard Hammond and James May carried A-bikes in their suitcases and unfolded them to bike from a ferry dock to a cable car.


== A-Bike Electric ==
In 2015, an electric version, the A-Bike Electric, was introduced to the public as part of a Kickstarter campaign. The design featured 20 cm (8 in) wheels, as well as a larger seat and sturdier frame. The funding campaign was successful and production began before the end of the year.

=== A-buffer ===
In computer graphics, A-buffer, also known as anti-aliased, area-averaged or accumulation buffer, is a general hidden surface mechanism suited to medium scale virtual memory computers. It resolves visibility among an arbitrary collection of opaque, transparent, and intersecting objects. Using an easy to compute Fourier window (box filter), it increases the effective image resolution many times over the Z-buffer, with a moderate increase in cost.
The A-buffer method is a descendant of the well known Z-buffer, which provides good quality results in moderate time.


== Uses ==
In 3-D image synthesis system, the balance between the quality and the cost of computation has always been needed. Using a full object-precision visible-surface algorithm at each pixel is expensive. A-buffer method provides moderate quality results in moderate cost of computation.
A-buffer helps in using visibility techniques and supports all conceivable geometric modeling primitives: polygons, patches, quadrics, fractals, and so forth. It also helps to handle transparency and intersecting surfaces (and transparent intersecting surfaces).


== Strategy ==
Carpenter's A-buffer algorithm addresses this problem by approximating Catmull's per-pixel object-precision area sampling with per-pixel image-precision operation performed on a sub-pixel grid. Polygons are first processed in scan-line order by clipping them to each square pixel they cover. This results in list of clipped polygon fragments corresponding to each square pixel. Each fragment has 4 by 8 bit mask of parts of the pixel it covers.
The bit-mask for a fragment is computed by xoring together masks representing each of the fragment's edges. When all polygons intersecting a pixel have been processed, the area-weighted average of the colors of the pixel's visible surfaces is obtained by selecting fragments in depth-sorted order and using their bit masks to clip those of farther fragments.
The bit masks can be manipulated efficiently with Boolean operations. For example, two fragment bit masks can be added together to determine the overlap between them. The A-buffer algorithm saves only a small amount of additional information with each fragment. For example. It includes the fragment's z extent, but no information about which part of the fragment is associated with these z values. Thus, the algorithm must make assumptions about the sub-pixel geometry in cases in which fragment bit masks overlap in z.

=== A-bus (Copenhagen) ===
A-buses are a type of city bus in Copenhagen that run frequently and make use of many stops around the city. They were introduced on October 20, 2002, by the now-defunct HUR Trafik, to coincide with the opening of the first stage of the Copenhagen Metro. Today, the A-buses are run by Movia, who outsource operations to various contractors. The buses are easily identifiable as yellow with red corners at the front and back.
As of October 13, 2019, there are 6 A-bus lines, and a further three which have been discontinued and one further line which was integrated into the Cityring. During rush hour, the buses don't follow a specific timetable, but they run instead at regular intervals which can be as short as 3–4 minutes. In the evenings, there are about 10 minutes between each A-bus, while at night they run every 20 to 30 minutes. On some stretches, however, only every other bus serves the entirety of the route. In 2019, the seven, and later six, A-bus lines carried 52.9 million passengers, equivalent to 26.7% of all Movia's passengers.
A-buses can also found in Køge, Roskilde, Ringsted, Holbæk and Helsingør, where Movia has set up several routes in each town between 2009 and 2011. This is also the case in Aarhus, where Midttrafik runs an A-bus service.


== General ==

A-buses were initially HUR Trafik's and now Movia's vision of bus rapid transit (BRT) for Copenhagen. Similar services are also found in many other larger cities, though under different names, such as the Metrobuses in Aalborg and blue buses in Stockholm. The concept involves creating routes with a frequent and direct service as their main attraction. They are easily identifiable with their red corners on the front-right and back-left sides. The bus stops are marked with red signs, and at many of them there is an automated countdown to the arrival of the next bus.
All the A-bus routes in Copenhagen run around the clock. The majority of the network runs on a time-interval based timetable. For most passengers there is no need for more specific information anyway as there is a departure every 10 minutes or less. On certain routes, and at night, a normal timetable is used as there is a longer period of time between buses.
Most of the A-bus lines use 13.7-metre long buses that allow space for plenty of passengers. However, on line 9A, a regular 12 metre bus is used, and on line 4A, a 13.2 metre long bus is used. Electric articulated buses are used on line 2A, and are able to charge at the final stop at each end of the route. It is possible to exit and enter buses using all doors on all six A-bus lines, including line 5C.


== History ==


=== Early Plans ===

The early plans for the A-buses came along with the establishment of the Copenhagen Metro which opened in stages in 2002–3, and which also led to a series of changes and reductions to the existing bus network. The network had been largely unchanged from the time of the conversion of the tramways in the 1960s, though there were a series of minor and more major changes including the introduction of S-buses throughout the 1990s. The expectation was, however, that 300,000 vehicle hours would be saved per year with the Metro in service. There was a danger that these changes could be seen as one-sided cuts to the bus service, especially as areas outside of the Metro coverage would be affected.
The 1998 Transit Plan for the Capital Region of Denmark outlined a simplification of the bus service in central districts. A network consisting of S-buses, supplemented by local services, was to be gradually built up. With a 10-minute service as the basis, it was estimated that it would create an easy-to-understand and attractive basic network.
In the autumn of 1999, HUR Trafik (HT) prepared a paper on a new bus network in the Copenhagen and Frederiksberg Municipalities, that could be operational by the time of the opening of the Metro in October 2002. This was followed in spring 2000 by a concrete proposal to HT's board of directors. It referred to, amongst other things, HT's own experience with S-buses that had resulted in high customer satisfaction. Furthermore, it also referred to BRT systems that had been introduced in other cities. For example, in Stockholm the "blue bus" routes were popularly referred to as "the street metro". Similarly, Jönköping successfully set up two similar services in 1996 which served the busiest travel routes with direct bus links. Both cities also supplemented these with different local routes.


=== Beginning of the A-bus service ===

The opening of the A-bus service took place on Sunday, October 20, 2002, with the 2A and 5A as the first lines opening after the official inauguration of the first stage of the Metro between Nørreport and Vestamager/Lergravsparken the day before. At the same time, a number of other lines were changed, especially on Amager, where the one hundred year old lines 2, 5 and 9 were discontinued and replaced with the 2A and 5A. A-buses also replaced the more recent lines 4E and 11.
There was a public information campaign in the weeks before and after the introduction of the A-buses. Magazines were sent out to homes near A-bus stops, and subscribers to the HUR Trafik customer information programme HT Linieinfo were informed about the A-buses through letters and emails. Furthermore, posters were put up in buses, and, in the first four weeks of the service, ten A-buses were decorated with campaign materials. Older buses from the Skjoldenæsholm Tram Museum were deployed for the final day of the old line 5 service on October 19, 2002. A few days later, the official inauguration of the A-bus service was made by HUR chairman Mads Lebech at an event which took place at Rådhuspladsen on October 21, 2002.


=== A-bus concept spreads beyond Copenhagen ===

With the structural reforms (Strukturreformen) that came into effect on January 1, 2007, the Greater Copenhagen Authority was disbanded. HUR Trafik, a division of the Greater Copenhagen Authority, was merged with two other transit agencies (Vestsjællands Trafikselskab and Storstrøms Trafikselskab) to form Movia.
By 2008, they were able to show the A-buses were a success. In the first 6 months of 2008, there were 2.5% more passengers on A-bus routes compared with the first 6 months of 2007, this was also happening at a time when passenger numbers in general were falling. Per Gellert, Movia's business development manager concluded that: "A-buses are meeting customers' desires for simplicity, many departures and up-to-date departure information. Armed with this knowledge of their popularity, we clearly hope to transfer this concept to other bus lines." It was unclear though, at that point, how this would happen. On the other hand, it was noted that the announcement was reminiscent of the success of the S-buses in the 1990s, which were similarly characterised by many departures, simple routes and an accurate information flow.
The expansion of the concept to other parts of the country came when 6 towns on Zealand introduced A-bus routes between 2009 and 2011. The first of these was the line 401A in Ringsted, which began service December 13, 2009. With a bus running every 15 minutes, the frequency of the service was and remains lower than that of Copenhagen; however, this frequency is high compared to similar local routes.
The concept also spread to Aarhus; Midttrafik set up 6 A-bus lines after a complete restructuring of the city bus network in 2011. The Aarhus A-bus system is, however, slightly different from the one on Zealand. One main difference is that the A-buses do not call at stops that other services also stop at. Originally, the buses also had the same red corner as the ones on Zealand, but these were gradually removed in 2014, and were completely gone by 2015.


=== New City Network ===
After many years under construction, the City Circle Line of the Copenhagen Metro was opened on September 29, 2019. It largely followed line 1A's previous route between Enghave Plads and Poul Henningsens Plads and weaved in and out of line 8A's route for the rest. On the way, it also intersects all the other A-bus routes; furthermore, other regular bus routes were also affected to varying degrees. Therefore, Movia introduced sweeping changes to the Copenhagen bus network on October 13, 2019, which they call the New City Network (Nyt Bynet). The basis for the changes was made in connection with the 2016 Transport Plan (Trafikplan 2016), which was approved by Movia's board of directors on February 23, 2017. The plans subsequently became more concrete with the presentation of the New City Network in January 2018, with only a few further changes.


=== Electric articulated buses ===
In December 2019, electric articulated buses were introduced on line 2A, with charging points at the final stops on the route. Some attempts were made to introduce them to line 3A, however, it was only on the 2A that all the buses were changed. The background to this was a decision from the Copenhagen City Council that, from 2019 onwards, there should be a requirement to offer environmentally friendly public transport such as electric buses. The choice of articulated buses was made to provide greater capacity on individual buses and thus make it possible to reduce the total number of buses running.


== The A-bus Network ==


=== Discontinued lines ===


== Passenger Numbers ==
The seven A-bus lines which existed in 2018 had a total of 58 million passengers that year. The most used line was the 1A with 10.9 million passengers, while line 3A was the least used with only 5 million passengers. In comparison, across all of Movia's services, there were 207.7 million passengers in 2018, of which the Copenhagen A-buses accounted for 27.9% of the total. In 2019, the seven, and later six A-buses, had a total of 52.9 million passengers. Movia's total number of passengers for all their services in 2019 was 198.2 million, of which the Copenhagen A-buses accounted for 26.7% of the total. The fall in passenger numbers for both A-buses and Movia's services in general should be viewed against the background of the opening of the City Circle Line on September 29, 2019.

=== A-ca-oo-mah-ca-ye ===
Aka-Omahkayii (also Ackomokki or A-ca-oo-mah-ca-ye (Blackfoot syllabics: ᖳᖿ ᖱᒍᑊᖿᔪ, meaning Old Swan), was the name of three Siksiká chiefs between the late 1700s and 1860.


== Aka-Omahkayii/Old Swan (I) ==
The first Aka-Omahkayii (d. January 1795) was described by Duncan M'Gillivray, the North West Company clerk at Fort George, as "once the greatest Cheif [sic] of this Nation and was respected and esteemed by all neighboring tribes." By the time Aka-Omahkayii was chief, the Blackfoot/Plains Confederacy had consolidated power throughout he plains of what is modern-day Montana, Alberta, and western Saskatchewan. He was known as a peacemaker who was open to trade with Europeans. Aka-Omahkayii realized that establishing a direct relationship with Euro-Canadian traders would benefit the Siksiká by bypassing Cree and Assiniboine middlemen. As he grew older, Aka-Omahkayii was forced to step aside as chief, but he remained a respected elder of the tribe until his death following a fall in 1795.


== Aka-Omahkayii/Old Swan (II)/Feathers ==
Aka-Omahkayii's son (d. October 1814) was known to fur traders as "Feathers" (or "Painted Feathers"). After his father's death he adopted the name Aka-Omahkayii, although Europeans continued to call him "Feathers" or "Many Swans" to distinguish him from his father. The elder Aka-Omahkayii's retirement led to a dispute over the tribe's leadership between the younger Aka-Omahkayii and Big Man/Gros Blanc (O-mok-a-pee), who struck a more hostile position toward white traders and other Native American tribes. Despite his early success as a warrior and hunter, younger Aka-Omahkayii adopted his father's policies and worked to preserve peace among his people and the neighboring Cree and Assiniboine peoples, as well as with European traders. By contrast, Big Man was openly hostile to other tribes and European traders, going so far as to participate in the 1793 Gros Ventre attack on the Hudson Bay Company's Manchester House.

In 1800, Aka-Omahkayii allowed the Hudson's Bay Company to establish the Chesterfield House trading post within the Blackfoot's wintering grounds at the confluence of the Red Deer and South Saskatchewan Rivers. By 1810, Aka-Omahkayii was recognized as leader of at least 60 percent of the Siksiká. However, changes in the balance of power between the Blackfoot and neighboring tribes brought on in part by westward expansion of U.S. traders lead to increasing conflicts and military decline for the Siksiká.
Around 1801, the Aka-Omahkayii drew for Hudson Bay Company surveyor Peter Fidler a detailed map of the lands around the Upper Missouri, including names of rivers, mountains, and peaks and travel time between them and information about 32 tribes populating the region. Aka-Omahkayii's maps included significant details about the topography and inhabitants of the area, which proved helpful in expanding the Hudson's Bay Company activities in the region. As redrawn by Fidler, the map shows the Rocky Mountains from modern central Wyoming to southern Alberta with peaks identified by Fidler in both Blackfoot and English translation. The following year, Fidler collected from Aka-Omahkayii a second map of the region that included pictographs marking summit features, for example a heart marking Heart Butte in the Lewis Range. Aka-Omahkayii's maps were later incorporated into the 1802 edition of Aaron Arrowsmith's map of the Interior Parts of North America.
In October 1814, Hudson Bay Company trader James Bird reported that Aka-Omahkayii had been shot and killed by "a man of their own nation but of another Tribe," likely a Kainai or Peigan.


== Aka-Omahkayii/Old Swan (III) ==
A third Old Swan (d. 1859/1860), possibly a son or nephew of the younger Aka-Omahkayii, assumed leadership of what was called by Europeans "Old Feathers' Band" by 1822. He was described in 1858 by Dr. James Hector as one of the three principal chiefs of the Blackfoot Confederacy (the other two being Crowfoot and Na-to-sa-pi), and, in July 1859, the Palliser Expedition were guests at his encampment on the Red Deer River.

=== A-center ===
An A-center is a type of crystallographic defect complex in silicon which consists of a vacancy defect and an impurity oxygen atom.
In general, oxygen in silicon is interstitial, in which the oxygen atom breaks the covalent bond between two adjacent silicon atoms and is attached in the middle. A-centers - another type of defect, in which oxygen takes the place of the absent silicon atom, that is, it becomes a kind of replacement defect.
The A-center is visible in infrared spectra with a wavelength of 12 μm.

=== A-choy ===
A-Choy (also known as AA Choy, Sword Choy, or You Mai Cai in English) is a leafy green vegetable that is a variety of lettuce, scientifically classified under Lactuca sativa, and a species in the Asteraceae family. Native to Southern Taiwan, the A-Choy is a staple of Taiwanese cuisine that is well known for its crisp stalks, tender leaves, and slightly sweet, mild flavor. The stem portion of the A-Choy is known as the celtuce or stem lettuce, and is often used as a vegetable in its own right.
Common pests that affect the A-Choy plant include: aphids, cabbage worms, slugs , snails, and flea beetles.


== Classifications ==


=== Scientific Classification ===
Kingdom: Plantae
Division: Magnoliophyta
Class: Eudicots
Order: Asterales
Family: Asteraceae
Genus: Lactuca
Species: Lactuca sativa


== Appearance ==
The A-Choy exhibits an upright growth habit, with mature plants typically reaching heights of 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 centimeters) and spreading 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 centimeters) in width. The plant features a thin root with a short, thick, and pale green stem that is approximately 0.2 to 0.4 inches (0.5 to 1 centimeter) in diameter at the base. Clusters of alternating, elongated, and slightly ruffled leaves grow from the top of the stem, each leaf measuring about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) in length and 3 to 5 inches (7.5 to 12.5 centimeters) in width. The leaves resemble those of romaine lettuce but are typically longer and narrower, offering a crunch similar to that of broccoli stalks or kohlrabi.


== Etymology ==
The term "A-Choy" originates from the Taiwanese Hokkien pronunciation of e-á-tshài, in which the beginning sound of the word sounds similar to the letter "A" in English, creating the common colloquial Taiwanese Chinese term for A-Choy, "A 菜". When the term was translated into English, the Chinese word for vegetable, "菜" (read as cài, or "choy") was added at the end of the name, thus coining the term "A-Choy".
In Cantonese speaking areas such as Guangdong Province and Hong Kong, A-Choy is known as You Mai Cai, whereas in the rest of Mainland China, the vegetable is simply known as You Mai or Xiang Shui Sheng Cai. In Taiwan, the term "You Mai Cai" may instead refer to Romaine lettuce.


== Cultivation ==

A-Choy thrives in various climates, particularly excelling in tropical, subtropical, and monsoonal environments. Cultivation during cooler months is advisable to prevent premature bolting. It grows best in well-drained soil rich in organic matter, with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Regular watering is essential to maintain soil moisture, but care should be taken to avoid over-watering, which can lead to root rot. Temperatures between 15 °C to 20 °C (59 °F to 68 °F) are preferable for the plant and the plant thrives in small gardens and is suitable for corner cultivation. The plant reaches maturity in approximately 30 to 45 days from sowing. Harvesting is typically done when the plant reaches 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 centimeters) in height, with both the stem (celtuce) and leaves (A-Choy) being edible.

=== A-class Melbourne tram ===
The A-class Melbourne tram is a class of bogie trams that operate on the Melbourne tram network. Seventy were built by Comeng, Dandenong between 1984 and 1987 in two batches, 28 A1s and 42 A2s, with only minor differences. They are the smallest trams by capacity currently operating on the network.


== History ==

Comeng had expected an extension to the Z-class order, and in the early 1980s drew up plans for a Z4-class, due to a change in state government in 1982 these plans were put on hold. The order eventuated however in late 1982, for 28 A1-class trams. At the same time, an order was placed for two B1 class articulated trams, making a total of 30 trams ordered. The design, which was shaped by input from passengers and tramway employees, had a series of alterations from the Z-class design. They did not include the conductors console seen in the Z-class and had a differing door arrangement. This posed a design challenge as there was less space to house equipment.
This order was extended in 1985 by 42, these were designated A2 due to a number of design changes, including a different door-operating mechanism. All 70 A1 and A2-class trams were built by Comeng's Dandenong factory, with 69 remaining in service. When the Melbourne tram network was privatised in August 1999, all passed to Yarra Trams.
Some trams had their rollsigns replaced with dot matrix equipment in 2005/06, before all were fitted with LED equipment in 2007. All were fitted with air-conditioning in the driver's cab in 2007.
In 2017, an automated on-board passenger information system was installed.


== Subclasses ==


=== A1-class ===
In late 1982, the state government approved an extension to the Z class order, the result being 28 A1-class which were built between 1983 and 1985. They were substantially based upon the Z-class design, with improved ventilation, and differing door positions. They had the same equipment as the Z3-class trams, AEG controls and Duewag bogies. However, placing all the Z3-class equipment under the frame posed a problem due to the differing door arrangement, as there were two step-wells where previously there was one, reducing the available space. Due to a desire to be less pointy and possess a flatter front, they were made shorter with less overhang, giving them a different appearance to the Z-class trams. The first A1-class was delivered on 12 December 1983 and entered service on 13 June 1984.
All were built with trolley poles, most being replaced with pantographs in 1987/88; six pole-equipped cars (231 to 236) were retaining for Chapel Street services, not being fitted with pantographs until the late-1990s.
In conjunction with celebrations for the 75th Anniversary of Kew Depot (which at the time was allocated all 70 of the A1 and A2-class trams) number 231 was painted in a 'chocolate-and-cream' livery in 1995, and displayed the monograms of some former Melbourne tram operators. It remained in this livery for a number of years afterwards.
As of August 2020, 27 remain in service, one (A1 231) having been withdrawn after being damaged by fire in June 2013.


=== A2-class ===
Following an extension to the A1-class order, 42 A2-class were built between 1985 and 1987. Many initially carried promotional advertising which indicated that the Commonwealth Government contributed towards their construction through the BiCentennial program. They were very similar to the A1 class, however they differ in being fitted with superior Hanning & Kahl brakes, and a more reliable door mechanism. They were the first Melbourne trams to enter service fitted with pantographs and without trolley poles. For use on the light-rail lines, A2 296 was fitted with high-beam headlights (similar to the B2-class) whilst retaining its A1/B1/A2 fibreglass apron. It was the only non-articulated tram so treated, although a small number of A1 and/or A2-class trams received B2-class aprons following repairs (without the extra high-beam headlights).


== Early Operation ==

Initially, these trams entered service at Kew Depot, however when the light-rail lines to St. Kilda and Port Melbourne opened in late 1987 a number of A2-class were allocated to South Melbourne and North Fitzroy Depots for these services. As the B2-class became available from late-1988, A2-class trams were returned one-by-one to Kew Depot where they remained throughout the 1990s. Both subclasses were used on routes 42 [Mont Albert - City], 48 [North Balwyn - Spencer St], and their respective peak-hour services to LaTrobe Street (routes 23 and 24), as well as other regular short-workings (e.g. Collins St or LaTrobe St shuttles, etc.).
For the Chapel Street services on routes 78 and 79 (North Richmond - Prahran, and North Richmond - St. Kilda Beach, both shared with Glenhuntly Depot) and Glenferrie Road school runs, only pole-equipped A1-class could be used until the late 1990s. Subsequent to the extension of the Mont Albert service to Port Melbourne as route 109, the A1-class were fitted with pantographs at the number '2' end (retaining the trolley pole at the other end): unusually, these conversions were done in (reverse) sequence from 300 to 237. A1-class 231 to 236 and a few SW6-class trams were kept at Kew Depot for use on the Chapel Street lines (although not exclusively, and could be seen on other routes); these were supplemented by a Z3-class tram in the late 1990s.
When route 78/79 overhead was converted to allow pantograph operation, these last six A1-class cars were also converted. As the C1-class vehicles entered service at Kew Depot in 2001 and 2002, displaced A1 and A2 class trams were re-allocated to Camberwell, Glenhuntly, Preston and Southbank Depots. Although trolley poles on the converted A1-class proved useful when pantographs became damaged in service, they were later removed by Yarra Trams.


== Current Operation ==
A-class trams operate on the following routes:

12: St Kilda Fitzroy St to Victoria Gardens
30: St Vincent's Plaza to Central Pier Docklands
48: North Balwyn to Victoria Harbour Docklands
70: Wattle Park to Waterfront City Docklands
75: Vermont South to Central Pier Docklands
78: North Richmond to Balaclava
109: Box Hill to Port Melbourne
A-class trams operated on the following routes prior to their abolition:

24: City to North Balwyn
31: Hoddle Street to Victoria Harbour Docklands
79: North Richmond to St Kilda Beach
95: Melbourne Museum to City
112: West Preston to St Kilda Fitzroy St

The A-class was a class of 20 trams built by Duncan & Fraser, Adelaide for the Prahran & Malvern Tramways Trust (PMTT). All passed to the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board on 2 February 1920 when it took over the PMTT becoming the A-class retaining their running numbers.
Fourteen were transferred to the isolated Footscray network in 1923/24. Three were converted to non-passenger use in 1925–27. The others were withdrawn in 1928–31.

=== A-class destroyer ===
A-class destroyer may refer to:

A-class destroyer (1929), Royal Navy destroyers
A-class destroyer (1913), Royal Navy torpedo boat destroyers

=== A-class destroyer (1913) ===
The A class as designated in 1913 was a heterogeneous group of torpedo boat destroyers (TBDs) built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1890s. Some 42 vessels were constructed to the individual designs of their builders to meet Admiralty specifications, the only uniting feature being a specified top speed of 27 knots (50 km/h). In fact the initial six vessels were generally differentiated by a slightly lower speed and were often referred to as "26-knotters" to distinguish them from the following batch of thirty-six vessels; all fifteen surviving "27-knotter" vessels were classified by the Admiralty as the A class in 1913 to provide some system to the naming of HM destroyers. All of the "26-knotters" and most of the "27-knotters" had been lost or scrapped before the 1913 classification (and so – strictly speaking – never survived to become 'A' class), but for convenience all 42 ships are listed below. The number of funnels varied from one to four. All vessels had a distinctive "turtleback" forecastle that was intended to clear water from the bow, but actually tended to dig the bow in to anything of a sea, resulting in a very wet conning position.
They generally displaced around 260 tons and had a length of around 200 feet (61 m). All were powered by triple expansion steam engines and had coal-fired water-tube boilers (although initially, some had "locomotive type" fire-tube boilers in lieu). Armament was generally one QF 12 pounder on a bandstand on the forecastle, up to five QF 6 pounder and 2 single tubes for 18-inch (457 mm) torpedoes. The six 1892–93 Programme ships initially had a third tube in the bow, fixed to fire straight ahead, but this was found to weigh down the bows and it was possible for the ship to run over its own torpedo when moving at high speed, so these were later removed and this feature was not repeated in later vessels.


== Ships ==


=== The 26-knotter group ===
Six ships were ordered under the 1892–93 programme:

Daring-class destroyer; both built by John I. Thornycroft & Company, Chiswick.
Daring, launched 25 November 1893, sold for breaking up 10 April 1912.
Decoy, launched 7 February 1894, sunk in collision with Arun 13 August 1904.
Havock-class destroyer; both built by Yarrow Shipbuilders, Poplar.
Havock, launched 12 August 1893, sold for breaking up 14 May 1912.
Hornet, launched 3 December 1893, sold for breaking up 12 October 1909.
Ferret-class destroyer; both built by Laird Brothers, Birkenhead.
Ferret, launched 9 December 1893, dismantled 1910 and sunk as target 1911.
Lynx, launched 24 January 1894, sold for breaking up 10 April 1912.


=== The 27-knotter group ===
Initially six torpedo boat destroyers (the Thornycroft and Yarrow vessels below) were ordered under the 1893–94 Programme, but a series of follow-up orders raised the programme to thirty-six vessels. The initial Estimates contained a sum of about £651,000 for payments on fourteen vessels, but the postponement of the First Class cruiser programme for that year allowed twenty-five destroyers to be ordered in that year, with the balance of eleven vessels funded under the 1894–95 Estimates (but still under the 1893–94 Programme).

Ardent-class destroyer; all built by John I. Thornycroft & Company, Chiswick.
Ardent, launched 16 October 1894, sold for breaking up 10 October 1911.
Boxer, launched 28 November 1894, lost in collision with SS St Patrick in the Channel 8 February 1918.
Bruizer, launched 27 February 1895, sold for breaking up 26 May 1914.

=== A-class lifeboat ===
A-class lifeboats are a series of lifeboats operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI):
Boats in this series include:

Hatch-class lifeboat, an RNLI lifeboat class using the Dell Quay Dory
McLachlan-class lifeboat, an RNLI lifeboat class constructed from GRP
Boston Whaler-class lifeboat, an RNLI lifeboat class using Boston Whalers

=== A-class minehunter ===
The A class is a class of minehunter vessels in the Turkish Navy. In 1999, the German shipyards Lürssen and Abeking & Rasmussen were contracted to build six Frankenthal-class ships for the Turkish Navy, a purchase worth US$630 million. While the first vessel was built in Germany, later ships were constructed by the Istanbul Naval Shipyard.
The Turkish Navy has become the second naval force in the world, after the German Navy, to use a non-magnetic steel hull in its minehunter vessels.

=== A-class minesweeper ===
The A class were four minesweepers of the Royal Netherlands Navy. They were the first purpose-built minesweepers of the Dutch Navy, as earlier minesweepers were converted tugboats.


== Design ==

The A class was based on the German FM-type of coastal minesweeper built during the First World War.


== History ==

All ships of the A class were built between 1928 and 1930 at Willemsoord, Den Helder. All four ships were commissioned on 4 August 1930, and two days later, on 6 August 1930, all four sailed to the Dutch East Indies, arriving at Surabaya on 30 October 1930.
During the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies in March 1942 all four ships were scuttled by their crews. Three of the ships, A, B and C, were salvaged and put into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy as auxiliary submarine chasers no. 113, 112 and 116, being rearmed with a single 47 mm gun, three 25 mm cannons, a 13.2 mm machine gun and eight depth charges. All three were sunk by US forces in 1944–1945.

=== A-class submarine ===
A-class submarine may refer to one of these classes of submarine:

A-class submarine, a class of 13 submarines of the Royal Navy that served in World War I
Havmanden-class submarine, a class of six built for the Royal Danish Navy, 1911–1914
Norwegian A-class submarine, a class built for the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1913
American Holland-class submarine, also later known as Soviet A-class submarine, submarines launched in 1916
Spanish A-class submarine, a class of three Spanish submarines launched in 1917
Plunger-class submarine, a class of seven United States Navy submarines built before World War I; also known as the "A class"
Amphion-class submarine (also called the Archeron class), a class of sixteen submarines of the Royal Navy that served in World War II; also known as the "A class"
The Japanese Type A submarine, three classes submarines:
I-9-class submarine (Type A1 submarine)
I-12-class submarine (Type A2 submarine)
I-13-class submarine (Type AM submarine)

=== A-class submarine (1903) ===
The A-class was the Royal Navy's first class of British-designed submarines. Thirteen were built by Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness between 1902 and 1905 as an improvement on the US Plunger class.  


== Design and construction ==
While there was considerable variation amongst the boats of the class, they were around 100 feet (30 m) long and displaced around 200 tons when submerged. The first, A1 (ordered as Holland No. 6), was launched in July 1902, the last, A13, in April 1905.


=== Propulsion ===
All were propelled underwater by battery-powered electric motors and on the surface by shaft-drive Wolseley petrol engines of 400 bhp (300 kW) (A1), 450 bhp (340 kW) (A2-A4) or 600 bhp (450 kW) (A5-A12). A13 had an experimental 500 bhp (370 kW) Vickers diesel engine, which proved to be unreliable.


=== Armaments ===
Armament was two 18-inch (46 cm) torpedo tubes with four torpedoes except for A1, which had 1 tube and 3 torpedoes.


== Service history ==
This submarine class was plagued by numerous accidents and failures; almost every boat in the class (A1, A3, A4, A5, A7, and A8) was involved in some sort of accident over the course of their operational history. Many were fatal to the crew, and resulted in the decommissioning of the submarine. A1 was sunk off Portsmouth on 18 March 1904, in collision with the liner Berwick Castle, but raised and put back into service before finally being sunk as a naval gunnery target in 1911, followed in 1912 by A3. A7 was lost in Whitsand Bay in 1914 after diving into mud. A13 was laid up in 1914 due to engine unreliability.
The remainder were used during World War I for harbour defence, A2 and A4, A5 and A6 at Portsmouth, A8 and A9 at Devonport, and A10, A11 and A12 at Ardrossan. All survived the war and were converted to training in 1918 and sold in 1919–1920 except for A2, which was wrecked while awaiting disposal and finally sold in 1925.

MaritimeQuest A Class Overview

=== A-class torpedo boat ===
The A-class torpedo boats were a class of German single-funnelled torpedo boat/light destroyer designed by the Reichsmarineamt for operations off the coast of occupied Flanders in the First World War.  The "A" designation was to avoid confusion with older classes and designs. They were classed officially as "coastal torpedo boats" (German: Küstentorpedoboote) to differentiate from larger, ocean-going torpedo boats.
Six groups of vessels were built under the class between 1914 and 1918, increasing in displacement from 109 to 335 t (107 to 330 long tons; 120 to 369 short tons). All had a raised forecastle, shallow draught, and carried one (for most) or two (for A1 – A25) 17.7 in (45 cm) torpedo tubes amidships.


== A-I type (A1 – A25) ==

All 25 were ordered in 1914, and were designed and built by A.G. 'Vulcan', at their Hamburg yard.

A2 and A6 were sunk by British destroyers on 1 May 1915 during the Battle off Noordhinder Bank.
A3 was sunk on 7 November 1915 en route from Kiel to Danzig.
A15 was sunk by French destroyers on 23 August 1915.
A13 was bombed in dock at Ostend on 16 August 1917.
A10 was sunk by mines off Flanders on 7 February 1918.
A7 and A19 were sunk by British and French destroyers off the Flanders coast on 21 March 1918.
A1, A18 and A21–A25 surrendered and were stricken between 1921 and 1922.
A11 and A17 were sunk during the Kapp Putsch in 1920.
A4, A12 and A14 were abandoned in Antwerp after the German evacuation at the end of the First World War. Taken over by Belgium. Remained operational until 1927.
A5, A8, A9,  A16 and A20 were interned in the Netherlands at the end of the war, and handed over to Belgium as reparations in 1919. Decommissioned in 1927 and most scrapped. A20 remained in use as training vessel and captured by Germans in 1940. Scrapped 1948.


== A-II type (A26 – A55) ==

All 30 were ordered in two batches - 24 vessels in 1915, and 6 added later. All were designed and built by F. Schichau Werke, at their Elbing yard. The second batch were 2 tonnes heavier, and had a breadth of 5.82 metres (18ft 5.25in).

A26–A29, A31, A33–A39, A41, A44–A46, A48, A49, and A52–A55 were surrendered and stricken between 1920 and 1921.
A30, A40, A42 and A47 interned in the Netherlands at end of the war and allocated to Belgium in 1919 under Versailles Treaty. Discarded in 1927.
A32 was sunk during the "Operation Albion" on 25 October 1917, raised and repaired in 1923, and served as Sulev in the Estonian Navy. Taken by Russia in October 1940, it was renamed Аметист ("Amethyst") and served in the Soviet Navy as a patrol vessel, then reduced to a tender in 1942 until scrapped in 1950.
A43 was scrapped in 1943.
A50 was mined in the North Sea on 17 November 1917.
A51 was scuttled at Fiume on 29 October 1918.


== A-III type - A. G. Vulcan design (A56 – A67, A80 – A91, and A96 – A113) ==

These 42 vessels were ordered in three batches - A56 to A67 in 1916, A80 to A91 in 1917, and A96 – A113 in 1918. Designed by A. G. Vulcan, who built all of them except for A83, A84 and A85, which were built by Howaldtswerke at Kiel, while the hulls of A64 to A67 were subcontracted to Seebeckwerft. None of the 1918 batch of 18 vessels were ever completed, and they were all stricken on 3 November 1918, some being up to 35% complete (these were broken up on the stocks) but none being launched.

A56–A58 were mined in 1918.
A59, A60 and A61 caused severe damage to HMS Terror on 19 October 1917.

These twelve vessels were ordered in 1916, and were designed and built by F. Schichau at Elbing.

A68 was transferred to Poland in 1921, becoming ORP Kujawiak. Converted to oil hulk 1939. Sunk by German bombers 3 September 1939 off Danzig.
A68, A69, A70, A74, A75, A76, and A78 all surrendered in September 1920 (and so were stricken) and were scrapped in 1922/23.
A71, A72, A73, A77 and A79 were all sunk by mines in the North Sea during 1918.


== A-III type - Schichau 1917 design (A92 – A95) ==

These last four vessels were designed and built by F. Schichau Werke, at their Elbing yard, with a slight variation in their dimensions from the 1916 design. The first two served in a minesweeper flotilla and the last two in an escort flotilla prior to the surrender.

All four vessels were scrapped at Bo'ness in 1923 (A93 in 1922).

=== A-dec ===
A-dec (Austin Dental Equipment Company) is a dental office furniture and equipment manufacturer based in Newberg, Oregon, United States.  It is considered one of the largest dental equipment makers in the world, and as of 2002 is Newberg's largest employer with 832 employees.  Founded in 1964, the company's annual revenue of $250 million comes from the sale of products such as dental chairs, stools, delivery systems, medical lighting, cabinetry, and other accessories.


== History ==
In 1964, Ken Austin built an improved air-powered vacuum system known as the Air-Venturi System, which varied from the belt-drive devices in use at the time. That same year the company released the first miniature delivery unit designed specifically for the new reclining patient chair, Dec-Et, followed by the complementary Tray-Cart, the first mobile dental assistant's work surface. The mobile equipment helped the company grow rapidly. In 1966, A-dec was incorporated, and at the time the company was housed in a Quonset hut in Newberg. They built a new plant and offices on 150 acres (0.61 km2) on the edge of Newberg in 1971. The company expanded distribution into 23 countries that year as well.
In 1977, A-dec offered a full line of instrument delivery systems. In subsequent years, the company added chairs, stools and dental lights, becoming a full service provider in the 1980s with revenues of $75 million annually by 1990. They developed a dental cabinetry line in 1983 as well as  building the self-contained water system, allowing dentists to have a controlled water supply to handpieces, and syringes, improving the industry's infection control. A-dec began a partnership with W&H, a family-run company based in Austria and a leading manufacturer of rotary dental instruments in 1985. The partnership positioned A-dec for new growth into the dental handpiece and ancillary equipment markets with the A-dec|W&H co-brand. In January 1990, they bought A-dec Diversified Inc., a company also in Newberg. The company grew to 600 employees by 1992. In 1999, the company was named as the 88th largest woman-owned company in the US.
A-dec introduced new products the Cascade and Radius in the 1990s, and in 2004 introduced the A-dec 500. The chair-mounted delivery system brought new technologies together for the first time and created an integrated system. The development of A-dec 500 led to streamlining the company's production lines and staging A-dec for a quicker time-to-market for its products. They also switched from a cold press to a hot press for their wood piece production at their 60,000-square-foot (5,600 m2) plant. The company was one of the leading contributors to a campaign to force a vote on a proposed income tax increase by the state legislature in 2003, which was defeated in 2004.
By 2006 the company had grown to almost 1,000 employees and annual revenue of $250 million. A-dec named Scott Parrish president of the company in 2007, replacing founder Ken Austin. In 2008, the company held a contest for dentists and gave the winners new office equipment. They also opened a new 25,000-square-foot (2,300 m2) training facility that year in Newberg. This facility doubles as a showroom for visiting dental professionals to view the company's products. The company introduced the A-dec 300, a fully integrated chair and delivery system with a smaller footprint in 2009. That year they also laid off 100 employees due to the worldwide economic downturn. In February of that year the company was fined by the Environmental Protection Agency and then reached a $325,700 settlement for selling an unregistered pesticide.
In 2024, A-dec announced the expansion of its business with the launch of the A-dec Certified Pre-Owned Equipment program. The company has developed a refurbishing process that includes a rigorous multi-point inspection to ensure the quality of its used dental equipment. A-dec's certified pre-owned equipment is sold in packages, with sales and installation managed by authorized A-dec dealers.


== Operations ==
Founders, George Kenneth 'Ken' Austin Jr. (1931–2019) and Joan D. Austin (1931–2013), developed the "A-dec Way", a written expression of the operating philosophy which governs all aspects of the company. Introduced in 1972, the philosophy contains 15 points from a concern for people to encouraging creativity among others. Employees receive profit sharing from the privately held corporation. The company's 40-acre (160,000 m2) campus in northeast Newberg has 11 buildings with 500,000 square feet (46,000 m2). As of 2003 the private company was debt free. Most of the equipment built is custom ordered by dentists.
The company has affiliations with the American Association of Women Dentists, American Dental Association, American Student Dental Association, Dental Trade Alliance, National Dental Association, British Dental Health Foundation, and Australian Dental Industry Association among others.
A-dec has won many award including being named as one of Oregon's Most Admired Companies by the Portland Business Journal in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Other awards include those from Dentaltown Magazine, Volunteers of America, the American Dental Education Association, Association of Fundraising Professionals, American Dental Association, and Oregon Business magazine.

Whitney topology compares the differences in successive derivatives and gives a notion of proximity within the infinite dimensional space.

these base sets.

The A-flat (A♭) clarinet is the highest-pitched instrument of the clarinet family still manufactured. It is just over half the length of the common B♭ clarinet and pitched a minor seventh higher, a perfect fourth higher than the E♭ clarinet. As a transposing instrument it sounds a minor sixth higher than written, thus the lowest written note E3 sounds as concert C4 (middle C).
Around the beginning of the 19th century, several small clarinets in different pitches appeared. The A♭ clarinet was adopted in European wind bands, particularly in Italy where it has appeared in Verdi's opera banda parts and survived to the present day in military bands. It is sometimes called for in contemporary classical music, in works by composers Béla Bartók and John Tavener, and in large clarinet choir works. It is manufactured by Italian makers Ripamonti and Orsi, and in Germany by Foag Klarinetten, Herbert Wurlitzer, and Schwenk & Seggelke.


== History of small clarinets ==

The clarinets pitched higher than the C clarinet are frequently taken together as a group, variously known as the "sopranino" or "piccolo" (Shackleton, Lawson), "high" or "little" (Tschaikov), or "small" (Baines, Rice) clarinets. They are known as piccolo in Italian, petite in French, and kleine in German, which are all words for small.
The group contains clarinets built in several pitches, the largest being the sopranino clarinets in D and E♭, to the smallest in high A, B♭ and C, sometimes called octave clarinets, built an octave above the more common instruments in those keys. British organologist Albert Rice in his 2017 survey counted eleven pitches of high clarinets, but noted that while the D♭ soprano and sopraninos in E and G♭ are mentioned in literature and catalogs, no known instruments in these pitches exist in museums or private collections.
Of the three highest and smallest "octave" clarinets, the A and B♭ clarinets found some use in 19th century Prussian and Russian military bands. The smallest, in C, was probably experimental, only found with simplified key work due to the tight fingering required of an instrument only 28 centimetres (11 in) long. Above the E♭ sopranino clarinet and below the octave clarinets, this leaves three small clarinets, in F, G, and A♭.
The F clarinet was used mainly in military bands from around 1780 until the mid-19th century; French composer Hector Berlioz noted in his 1843 landmark Treatise on Instrumentation that it had been all but replaced by the E♭ clarinet. British composer and musicologist Cecil Forsyth in his 1914 orchestration treatise associated the high clarinets with Austria, saying "Clarinets in (high) F, and even in (high) A♭ are occasionally used abroad. The latter instrument is regularly employed in the Austrian military bands."
The G clarinet found some brief fame in Viennese small ensembles, particularly the Schrammelmusik of 1880s Vienna, where it gained the nickname picksüsses Hölzl, possibly Viennese slang for "fabulous matchstick". The music was originally performed by a quartet of two violins (the brothers Johann and Josef Schrammel), a contraguitar, and the G clarinet played by Georg Dänzer. It was first recorded by players of the Vienna Philharmonic, with principal clarinet Richard Schönhofer playing the high G clarinet, after the original parts were found in the 1960s.
The A♭ clarinet first appeared in the early 19th century and was adopted mainly by European wind bands. It survived in military bands, particularly in Spain and Italy at least through the middle of the 20th century. In Italy, particularly in band scores, the terms sestino and occasionally settimino referred to the A♭ clarinet, the pitch being a sixth or seventh above the C or B♭ clarinets, respectively. In some manuscripts, a clarinet with the term Alafà indicated the piccolo in A♭. It has found a niche in contemporary art music and clarinet choirs, and the A♭ and G clarinets are the only sizes of clarinet higher than the E♭ sopranino still manufactured.


== Construction ==

The A♭ clarinet is just over half the length of the common B♭ clarinet, at around 360 millimetres (14 in) in length.
Its small size requires more compact key work, and is usually constructed with a one-piece body that combines the separate upper and lower joints and the barrel found on larger clarinets. The bell and mouthpiece remain separate pieces.
Several manufacturers produce A♭ clarinets: Italian makers L. A. Ripamonti, Mario Corso, and Orsi, and in Germany, Foag Klarinetten, Herbert Wurlitzer, and Schwenk & Seggelke. Leblanc made A♭ clarinets until at least the 1980s. Ripamonti, Foag, Wurlitzer and Schwenk & Seggelke produce A♭ clarinets with German and French system key work, and the German makers also make German system G clarinets.


== Repertoire ==
The A♭ clarinet initially found its widest use in 19th century European wind and military band music. Italian opera composers wrote for the instrument in the stage band parts in their operas, for example Gaetano Donizetti's Alfredo il grande (1823), and Giuseppe Verdi's Ernani (1844), La traviata (1853), and Un ballo in maschera (1859).
The A♭ clarinet has appeared occasionally in 20th-century music. Béla Bartók wrote for it in his 1905 Scherzo for Piano and Orchestra op. 2 ("mostly in unison with the E♭ or piccolo [flute]"). Dutch composer Matthijs Vermeulen's Fourth Symphony, published in 1941, includes a part for A♭ clarinet, as does the 1969 A Celtic Requiem by English choral composer John Tavener. German avant-garde composer Hans-Joachim Hespos uses the A♭ clarinet in his 1972 large orchestral work, Interactions. Several of his chamber works also employ the A♭ clarinet; his 1978 work go also includes soprano sarrusophone, heckelphone, and tárogató. Canadian composer Samuel Andreyev includes A♭ "piccolo clarinet" in his chamber works Vérifications (2012) and Iridescent Notation (2017).
The A♭ clarinet is sometimes used in clarinet choir arrangements, including several by French-American composer Lucien Cailliet, though the instrument is often optional or cued in other voices.

=== A-flat major ===
A-flat major is a major scale based on A♭, with the pitches A♭, B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, and G. Its key signature has four flats.
The A-flat major scale is:

Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary. The A-flat harmonic major and melodic major scales are

Its relative minor is F minor. Its parallel minor, A-flat minor, is usually written instead as the enharmonic key of G-sharp minor, since A-flat minor, which contains seven flats, is not normally used. Its enharmonic, G-sharp major, with eight sharps, including the F, has a similar problem, and so A-flat major is often used as the parallel major for G-sharp minor. (The same enharmonic situation also occurs with the keys of D-flat major and C-sharp minor, and to some extent, the keys of G-flat major and F-sharp minor).)


== Scale degree chords ==
The scale degree chords of A-flat major are:

Tonic – A-flat major
Supertonic – B-flat minor
Mediant – C minor
Subdominant – D-flat major
Dominant – E-flat major
Submediant – F minor
Leading-tone – G diminished


== Compositions in A-flat major ==

Beethoven chose A-flat major as the key of the slow movement for most of his C minor works, a practice which Anton Bruckner imitated in his first two C minor symphonies and also Antonín Dvořák in his only C minor symphony. The second movement of Haydn's 43rd symphony in E-flat major is in A-flat major. Frédéric Chopin used this key in many of his works, particularly in his waltzes.
Since A-flat major was rarely chosen as the main key for orchestral works of the 18th century, passages or movements in the key often retained the timpani settings of the preceding movement. For example, Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 has the timpani set to C and G for the first movement. With hand-tuned timpani, there is no time to re-tune the timpani to A-flat and E-flat for the slow second movement in A-flat major; accordingly, the timpani in this movement are reserved for the passages in C major. In Bruckner's Symphony No. 1 in C minor, however, the timpani are re-tuned between the first movement in C minor and the following in A-flat major.
Charles-Marie Widor considered A-flat major to be the second best key for flute music.
A-flat major was the flattest major key to be used as the home key for the keyboard and piano sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti, Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, with each of them using the key for two sonatas: Scarlatti's K. 127 and K. 130, Haydn's Hob XVI 43 and 46, and Beethoven's Op. 26 and Op. 110, while Franz Schubert used it for one piano sonata. It was also the flattest major key to be used for the preludes and fugues in Johann Sebastian Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, as flatter major keys were notated as their enharmonic equivalents.
Felix Mendelssohn, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, John Field, and Friedrich Kalkbrenner each wrote one piano concerto in A-flat (Mendelssohn's being for two pianos); they had the horns and trumpet tuned to E-flat. Max Bruch's Concerto for Two Pianos in A-flat minor has its last movement in A-flat major, which is the parallel major; this concerto plays with the contrast between the two keys.
Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag is also written in A-flat major (the trio part of the composition is written in D-flat major).

== Music in A-flat minor ==
Although A-flat minor occurs in modulation in works in other keys, it is only rarely used as the principal key of a piece of music. Some well-known uses of the key in classical and romantic music include:

The Funeral March in Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 12, Op. 26.
An early section of the last movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 31, Op. 110 (although the key signature of this section uses only 6 flats, not 7).
The second Trio in Franz Schubert's Klavierstücke in E-flat major for Piano, D946/2.
Schubert's Impromptu in A♭ major actually begins in A♭ minor, though this is written as A♭ major with accidentals.
The second movement of Ferdinand Ries' Concerto No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra in E-flat Major, also written as A♭ major with accidentals.
The first piece "Aime-moi" ("Love me") from Charles-Valentin Alkan's Trois morceaux dans le genre pathétique
Max Bruch's Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, Op. 88a, although the piece ends in A-flat Major.
The Evocación from Book I of Isaac Albéniz's Iberia.
Isaac Albéniz's La Vega.
Etude No.13 in Moritz Moszkowski's Études de Virtuosité, Op. 72, although it ends in A-flat major.
Leoš Janáček uses it for his Violin Sonata and the organ solo of his Glagolitic Mass.
The opening of Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird.
Franz Liszt's original version of "La campanella" from Grandes études de Paganini, which was subsequently rewritten in G-sharp minor.
In Gustav Mahler's Ninth Symphony, there is a particularly aggressive restatement of the introduction of the third movement in A-flat minor.
The first movement of Charles Koechlin's Partita for Chamber Orchestra, Op. 205, is in A-flat minor, and the earlier A-flat-minor portion is written with a 7-flat key signature, but the later A-flat-minor portion is written without any key signature, and uses the necessary flats as accidentals.
It is also used in Frederick Loewe's score to the 1956 musical play My Fair Lady; the Second Servants' Chorus is set in A-flat minor (the preceding and following choruses being a semitone lower and higher respectively).
Antonín Dvořák's String Quartet No. 14, Op. 105, opens in A-flat minor.

More often, pieces in a minor mode that have A-flat's pitch as tonic are notated in the enharmonic key, G-sharp minor, because that key has just five sharps as opposed to the seven flats of A-flat minor.
In some scores, the A-flat minor key signature in the bass clef is written with the flat for the F on the second line from the top.

=== A-frame ===
An A-frame is a basic structure designed to bear a load in a lightweight economical manner. The simplest form of an A-frame is two similarly sized beams, arranged in an angle of 45 degrees or less, attached at the top, like an uppercase letter 'A'. These materials are often wooden or steel beams attached at the top by rope, welding, gluing, or riveting. 
A-frames can be used as-is, as part of shears, or set up in a row along a longitudinal beam for added stability, as in a saw horse. More complex structures will often have crossmembers connecting the A-frames at different angles, forming a truss.

=== A-frame building ===
An A-frame building is an architectural style of building that features steeply-angled sides (roofline) that usually begin at or near the foundation line, and meet at the top in the shape of the letter A. An A-frame ceiling can be open to the top rafters.
Although the triangle shape of the A-frame has been present throughout history, it surged in popularity around the world from roughly the mid-1950s through the 1970s. It was during the post–World War II era that the A-frame acquired its most defining characteristics.


== Style ==
A-frame buildings are an ancient form in Europe (e.g. cruck frame construction or grubenhaus), China, and the South Pacific islands. Sometimes called a roof hut, these were simple structures used for utilitarian purposes until the 1950s. In 1934, R. M. Schindler built the first modern A-frame house, for owner Gisela Bennati, in Lake Arrowhead, California.  Architects Walter Reemelin, John Campbell, George Rockrise, Henrik H. Bull, and Andrew Geller helped to popularize Schindler's idea in the early 1950s, designing A-frame vacation homes. In 1955, Andrew Geller built an A-frame house on the beach in Long Island, New York, known as the Elizabeth Reese House. Geller's design won international attention when it was featured in The New York Times on May 5, 1957. Before long, thousands of A-frame homes were being built around the world.
The Abbey Resort in Fontana-on-Geneva Lake, Wisconsin, claims to have the world's tallest wooden A-frame.


== Rise in popularity ==
The post–World War II popularity of the A-frame has been attributed to a combination of factors including Americans' extra disposable income, the inexpensiveness of building an A-frame structure, and a new interest in acquiring a second home for vacationing.
Another factor contributing to the rise of the A-frame included the adaptability of the structure itself, which enabled architects to experiment with more modern designs. A-frames were a useful medium in which architects could explore their creative side since they were relatively cheap to build.
Additionally, many people preferred the idea of a "modern-style" vacation home to that of a "modern-style" primary home. A-frames became available as prefabricated kits, lowering the cost even more, and were sold by Macy's department stores.
After the rise of the archetypal A-frame, architects soon began experimenting with new designs, which led to what became known as the modified A-frame style.

=== Religious examples ===
A-frame buildings which had been made popular since 1955 by Andrew Geller were built for churches across the world. The modern shape was reinterpreted spiritually as representing "hands at prayer" since 1961 and the design of the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Tokyo by the Czech-born American architect Antonin Raymond. His use of interlaced pillars was inspired by the traditional Japanese traditional country minka houses known as gasshō-zukuri (合掌造り), literally "clasped-hands style".
Early examples of A-frame religious buildings are the Frank Lloyd Wright designed First Unitarian Society of Madison, built 1949–1951, as well as the Lutheran Church of the Atonement, designed by Harris Armstrong and built in 1949 in Florissant, Missouri. Charles E. Stade designed dozens of A-frame church buildings in the United States throughout the 1950s and 1960s, along with Edward D. Dart and Edward Sövik. The style was in 1960 used by the Catholic Church to build Saint Joseph Church, Lynden, Washington just before the Our Lady of Fatima Roman Catholic Church in 1961. It was used most impressively for the United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel inaugurated in 1962.

At the same time, the A-frame used was in Europe as early 1959 for Bakkehaugen Church in Norway by architect Ove Bang who was an advocate of functionalism. When the Arctic Cathedral in 1965, the A-frame church had become a new identity of religious architecture in Scandinavia. It spread to Europe and was used in 1967 to build the Yaddlethorpe Methodist Church in Yaddlethorpe.
The A-shape religious building made it across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand with the Whiteley Memorial Methodist Church dedicated on 19 October 1963 considered as "Taranaki's most beautiful building".

Christian religious buildings have also adopted the A-style architecture mainly in South East Asia. The first example after Japan might be the Luce Memorial Chapel in Taiwan in 1963, followed by Saint Michael's Church in Sihanoukville in 1965, Xavier Hall Catholic Church in Bangkok in 1972, or the Church of the Pastoral Center in Da Lat in 2010 are some examples of a similar architectural style.
This style is still popular in Europe also, as in Henry's Ecumenical Art Chapel in Finland in 2005.

=== A-frame complex ===
In organometallic chemistry, A-frame complexes are coordination compounds that contain two bridging bidentate ligands and a single atom bridge.  They have the formula M2(μ-X)(bd)2L2, where bd is a bidentate ligand like dppm, and X and L are a wide variety of ligands.  The term was coined to describe products arising from the oxidative addition to Rh(I)Rh(I) complexes.


== Scope of compounds ==
A-frame complexes typically consist of a pair of square-planar metal centres. Consequently, this family of complexes is found for those metals that tend to adopt that geometry, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, and Au.  In addition to dppm, the analogous tetramethyldiphosphine (dmpm) also forms such complexes as do some related ligands, such as diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine.  The bridging site can be occupied by a variety of ligands, including CO, SO, NO, CH2, hydride, and chloride.


== Preparation ==
A frame complexes are often produced by the addition of reagents of the type AX2 to low valent complexes of dppm:

2 M(0)  +  AX2  +  2 dppm   →   M2(μ-A)(dppm)2X2
Alternatively the group "A" can be added across a preformed M-M bond, as indicated by the oxidative addition of elemental sulfur:

Pd2(dppm)2Cl2  +  S   →   Pd2(μ-S)(dppm)2Cl2

=== A-group ===
In mathematics, in the area of abstract algebra known as group theory, an A-group is a type of group that is similar to abelian groups.  The groups were first studied in the 1940s by Philip Hall, and are still studied today.  A great deal is known about their structure.


== Definition ==
An A-group is a finite group with the property that all of its Sylow subgroups are abelian.


== History ==
The term A-group was probably first used in (Hall 1940, Sec. 9), where attention was restricted to soluble A-groups.  Hall's presentation was rather brief without proofs, but his remarks were soon expanded with proofs in (Taunt 1949).  The representation theory of A-groups was studied in (Itô 1952).  Carter then published an important relationship between Carter subgroups and Hall's work in (Carter 1962).  The work of Hall, Taunt, and Carter was presented in textbook form in (Huppert 1967).  The focus on soluble A-groups broadened, with the classification of finite simple A-groups in (Walter 1969) which allowed generalizing Taunt's work to finite groups in (Broshi 1971).  Interest in A-groups also broadened due to an important relationship to varieties of groups discussed in (Ol'šanskiĭ 1969).  Modern interest in A-groups was renewed when new enumeration techniques enabled tight asymptotic bounds on the number of distinct isomorphism classes of A-groups in (Venkataraman 1997).


== Properties ==
The following can be said about A-groups:

Every subgroup, quotient group, and direct product of A-groups are A-groups.
Every finite abelian group is an A-group.
A finite nilpotent group is an A-group if and only if it is abelian.
The symmetric group on three points is an A-group that is not abelian.
Every group of cube-free order is an A-group.
The derived length of an A-group can be arbitrarily large, but no larger than the number of distinct prime divisors of the order, stated in (Hall 1940), and presented in textbook form as (Huppert 1967, Kap. VI, Satz 14.16).
The lower nilpotent series coincides with the derived series (Hall 1940).
A soluble A-group has a unique maximal abelian normal subgroup (Hall 1940).
The Fitting subgroup of a solvable A-group is equal to the direct product of the centers of the terms of the derived series, first stated in (Hall 1940), then proven in (Taunt 1949), and presented in textbook form in (Huppert 1967, Kap. VI, Satz 14.8).
A non-abelian finite simple group is an A-group if and only if it is isomorphic to the first Janko group or to PSL(2,q) where q > 3 and either q = 2n or q ≡ 3,5 mod 8, as shown in (Walter 1969).
All the groups in the variety generated by a finite group are finitely approximable if and only if that group is an A-group, as shown in (Ol'šanskiĭ 1969).
Like Z-groups, whose Sylow subgroups are cyclic, A-groups can be easier to study than general finite groups because of the restrictions on the local structure.  For instance, a more precise enumeration of soluble A-groups was found after an enumeration of soluble groups with fixed, but arbitrary Sylow subgroups (Venkataraman 1997).  A more leisurely exposition is given in (Blackburn, Neumann & Venkataraman 2007, Ch. 12).

=== A-ha ===
A-ha (often stylised as a-ha; Norwegian pronunciation: [ɑˈhɑː]) is a Norwegian synth-pop band formed in Oslo in 1982. Founded by Paul Waaktaar-Savoy (guitars and vocals), Magne Furuholmen (keyboards, guitars and vocals), and Morten Harket (lead vocals), the band rose to fame during the mid-1980s.
A-ha achieved their biggest success with their debut album Hunting High and Low in 1985. The album peaked at number one in their native Norway, number two in the UK, and number 15 on the US Billboard album chart; yielded the international number-one single "Take On Me", as well as "The Sun Always Shines on T.V."; and earned the band a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist. In the UK, Hunting High and Low continued its chart success into the following year, becoming one of the best-selling albums of 1986. The band released studio albums in 1986, 1988, and 1990, with single hits including "Hunting High and Low", "The Living Daylights", "Stay on These Roads", and "Crying in the Rain". In 1994, after their fifth studio album, Memorial Beach (1993), failed to achieve the commercial success of their previous albums, the band went on hiatus. Following a performance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, A-ha recorded their sixth album, 2000's Minor Earth Major Sky, which was another number-one album in Norway and Germany. This album was followed by Lifelines (2002); Analogue (2005), which was certified Silver in the UK; and Foot of the Mountain (2009), which was certified Silver in the UK and reached the top five in many European countries.
The band split after their 2010 worldwide Ending on a High Note Tour, but reunited in 2015 to release their tenth studio album, Cast in Steel. They toured in support of the album and participated at Rock in Rio, which celebrated 30 years for both the band and the event.
The band has released eleven studio albums, several compilations and four live albums, with their most recent album, True North, released on 21 October 2022. In less than a year, during 2010, the band earned an estimated 500 million Norwegian kroner from concert tickets, merchandise and the release of a greatest hits album, making them one of the 40–50 highest-grossing bands in the world. The band were listed in the Guinness World Records book for having the biggest-paying rock concert attendance; they drew an audience of 198,000 at Maracanã Stadium during the Rock in Rio festival. They have sold more than 100 million units, albums and singles combined.


== History ==


=== Formation ===

The trio, composed of lead vocalist Morten Harket; guitarist Paul Waaktaar (then known as Pål Waaktaar); and keyboardist Magne Furuholmen, formed in 1982, and left Norway for London in order to make a career in music. "We were trying to think of what to call themselves, focusing on Norwegian words people could say in English." They jettisoned that idea when Morten spotted a song called "A-ha" in Waaktaar's songbook. "It was a terrible song but a great name," said Morten.
They chose the studio of musician, producer, and soon-to-be-manager John Ratcliff because it had a Space Invaders machine. Ratcliff introduced them to his manager, Terry Slater, and after a few meetings, A-ha enlisted Ratcliff as a manager as well. Slater and Ratcliff formed TJ Management. Ratcliff dealt with technical and musical aspects and Slater acted as the group's international business manager and as liaison to Warner Bros. head office in Los Angeles.


=== Hunting High and Low (1984–1986) ===
An early version of "Take On Me" was the first song that Harket had heard Furuholmen and Waaktaar play in Asker. At that time, the song was called "Miss Eerie" and the two men were still known as Bridges. Harket said it sounded more like a "Juicy Fruit song" (meaning a gum advertisement). A-ha's first recorded version was called "Lesson One". The song was then re-recorded, re-named "Take on Me", and released in 1984, when it was promoted with a video of the band performing in front of a blue background. After it failed to chart, the song was re-recorded with production by Alan Tarney; it again failed to chart. Finally, the song was re-released in 1985 with a new, groundbreaking video; this time, the song peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at number two on the UK Singles Chart.
a-ha became the first Norwegian band to have a number-one hit in the U.S. The popularity of "Take on Me" earned the band a spot on the American television series Soul Train in 1985, making them one of the few white artists to appear on the black music-oriented show. (Earlier Soul Train appearances by white artists included Gino Vanelli, Elton John, David Bowie, Hall & Oates, Sheena Easton, Pet Shop Boys, Michael McDonald, and Teena Marie.)
The video used a pencil-sketch animation/live-action combination called rotoscoping, in which individual frames of film are drawn over or coloured. It became one of the most instantly recognizable and most enduringly popular music videos in the US, where it was nominated for eight awards at the third annual MTV Video Awards in 1986, winning six, including Best New Artist in a Video, Best Concept Video, Best Direction, Best Special Effects, Viewer's Choice and Best Video of the Year. Their six MTV Award wins for that video gave them twice as many wins as Michael Jackson's "Thriller" and more than any artist in the three years of the awards combined.

 
The band's second single worldwide was "The Sun Always Shines on T.V.", even though "Love Is Reason" was the second single in Norway. In the US, the song peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number 17 on Radio & Records airplay chart. A remix version was a club hit, rising to number five on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. The music video for the song was another popular and critical success, nominated at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in three categories and winning two, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, bringing A-ha's total to 11 nominations and eight wins. The following year, Peter Gabriel would earn 13 nominations and win nine awards, also for two separate videos. In successive years, even as the award categories expanded, only a few artists have approached—and none have surpassed the single-year award totals of A-ha and Gabriel.
a-ha's American success culminated in their 1986 Grammy nomination in the Best New Artist category, which was eventually won by Sade. "The Sun Always Shines on T.V." turned out to be A-ha's last Hot 100 Top 40 single and to this day – in the United States – A-ha is remembered by the general public almost entirely because of "Take On Me". As such, the band is frequently considered a one-hit wonder there, despite their two Top 40 hits. In the UK, where "The Sun Always Shines on T.V." has been their only number one, A-ha enjoyed continued success with two more hit singles from the same album, "Train of Thought" and "Hunting High and Low" (with another innovative video), and remained popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.
The band's first album, 1985's Hunting High and Low, became a worldwide bestseller, spending most of October and November in the top 20 of Billboard's Top 200 album chart. The album and its four hit singles garnered international recognition for A-ha. Hunting High and Low earned triple platinum status in the UK and reached platinum status in the US and Germany, while earning gold in Brazil and the Netherlands. Hunting High and Low has sold 11 million copies worldwide. The album peaked at number 15 on the US on the Billboard 200 albums chart and at number two on the UK Albums Chart; it spent 38 weeks in the top 10 in Norway, including eight weeks at number one.


=== Golden age (1987–1994) ===
a-ha's second album, Scoundrel Days, was released in the midst of the 1986 world tour and represented a move towards alternative rock, as synthpop began to fall out of style. Although the album received favourable reviews and had three singles become international hits, sales (6.4 million copies) did not match those of its predecessor (except for in Switzerland, where it remains A-ha's best-selling album). "Cry Wolf" would be the last A-ha single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. After the release of the album, A-ha toured in the US, its last appearance there for 20 years. The album has been certified platinum in the UK, Switzerland and Brazil, and has earned gold certification in Germany.
Ned Raggett of AllMusic Guide would later write of the album, "The opening two songs alone make for one of the best one-two opening punches around: the tense edge of the title track, featuring one of Morten Harket's soaring vocals during the chorus and a crisp, pristine punch in the music, and 'The Swing of Things,' a moody, elegant number with a beautiful synth/guitar arrangement (plus some fine drumming courtesy of studio pro Michael Sturgis) and utterly lovelorn lyrical sentiments that balance on the edge of being overheated without quite going over...The '80s may be long gone, but Scoundrel Days makes clear that not everything was bad back then."
In May 1988, A-ha released their third studio album, titled Stay on These Roads, which matched the number-two chart peak of its two predecessors on the British album charts. Stay on These Roads has been certified platinum in Brazil and France, and gold in Switzerland, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands.
The album includes the title-track theme song to the James Bond film The Living Daylights. The version that appears on their album is the original version of the song. The band has said that they are particularly proud of the title track, and all three members contributed to its writing. "Stay on These Roads" and "The Living Daylights" would remain part of their live set throughout the rest of the band's history. After the release of the album, the band went on a 74-city world tour. The album has sold more than 4.2 million copies worldwide.

 
East of the Sun, West of the Moon contained a cover version of The Everly Brothers' 1963 single "Crying in the Rain". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, A-ha were very popular in South America, especially in Brazil, where the band sold out some of the largest stadiums in the world. At the January 1991 Rock in Rio II festival, A-ha shocked the international entertainment press by drawing an audience of 198,000 at Maracanã stadium for their top-billed evening concert—a Guinness World Record for biggest rock concert attendance. In contrast, the other performers (George Michael, Prince and Guns N' Roses) each drew less than a third of that audience (60,000 each). In a 2009 interview from Cody Eide in Music Week, celebrating A-ha's up-and-coming 25-year anniversary, the members revealed that the record-breaking concert and the lack of media attention they received were a devastating blow to the band. The festival, which should have been the band's crowning achievement, was instead a moment of crushing disappointment. "MTV interviewed everybody except us", remembers Waaktaar-Savoy. "They were all calling their bosses and saying, 'We must cover A-ha; it's the only night that has sold out.' But they weren't allowed to." "I felt very alienated," says Furuholmen. "It made us feel hopeless. We played to the biggest crowd in the world and they ignored it."
East of the Sun, West of the Moon was certified gold in Switzerland, Brazil, and Germany and silver in the UK. Steven McDonald of AllMusic said of their fourth album, "This is a nicely crafted collection of songs, performed and sung beautifully, with lots of echoes and suggestions tucked into the music. While not an album one can discuss at length, it's an album that's a pleasure to listen to." The album sold 3.2 million copies worldwide.
Their last album before their hiatus was Memorial Beach, in 1993. Relative to previous releases, the album was a commercial disappointment. The only single from the album to chart officially outside of Norway was "Dark Is the Night", which peaked at number 19 in the United Kingdom.  Despite the commercial reception, Q magazine listed the album as one of the 50 best albums of 1993. The following February, A-ha performed two concerts during the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, followed by tours in South Africa and Norway. A-ha were also chosen to compose the official song for the Winter Paralympic Games in Lillehammer, which they entitled "Shapes That Go Together".
In 1994, the band unofficially entered a hiatus, during which band members focused on solo projects.


=== First comeback (1998–2007) ===

The band was invited to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998. Waaktaar-Savoy wrote "Summer Moved On" especially for this performance. They also performed "The Sun Always Shines on T.V." This performance was A-ha's comeback into the world of music, yet the band's set was controversially omitted from a programme of concert highlights that was televised in the UK, and even more controversially in the US by FOX. Nevertheless, the band returned to the studio. Those recording sessions resulted in 2000's Minor Earth Major Sky, an international tour, and a webcast performance of the band opening the new Vallhall Arena in Oslo on 24 and 25 March 2001. A-ha's video for "I Wish I Cared" was one of the first fully web-based animated Macromedia Flash music videos to be made available. (The first was Duran Duran's 2000 video for "Someone Else Not Me".) The album reached platinum status, with sales of 1.5 million copies, and spawned four singles: "Summer Moved On", "Minor Earth Major Sky", "Velvet" and "The Sun Never Shone That Day". "Summer Moved On" went to number one in 17 countries.
a-ha made a return appearance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 2001, performing a new song, "Differences", and "Hunting High and Low". The subsequent album, Lifelines, was released in 2002, going platinum in Norway and producing two top-five hits there, "Forever Not Yours" and "Lifelines". Jesper Hiro directed the video for "Lifelines", based on the short film A Year Along the Abandoned Road, which was directed by Morten Skallerud in 1991. The original short film was 12 minutes long; it shows a whole year elapsing in one shot at 50,000 times the normal speed.
A live album from their 2002 tour, titled How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head, was released in March 2003, preceded by a live single of the 1986 hit "The Sun Always Shines on T.V." In 2004, a book entitled The Swing of Things was published, which also included a CD of early demo material titled The Demo Tapes. That year, A-ha celebrated their 20th anniversary with the release of a new singles collection, The Definitive Singles Collection 1984–2004. This compilation brought them back into the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart, where they reached number 13 and earned a gold album.
On 2 July 2005, A-ha performed at the Berlin edition of Live 8 in front of an audience of nearly 200,000 people. They began with "Hunting High and Low", followed by "Take On Me", during which Morten Harket had difficulties hearing himself when his in-ear monitor failed: he requested a two-minute break, which he used to comment on the cause of Live 8. The intended two minutes became almost seven, and the third song, "Summer Moved On", became the last of their set. Although four songs had been rehearsed, the band's time had run out and the organisers told them to leave the stage.

On 12 September 2005, A-ha played a quickly sold-out show at Irving Plaza in New York City, the band's first concert in North America since 1986, despite not having released any material there since 1993. On 27 August 2005, the band played a concert for 120,000 people in Frogner Park in Oslo, the largest concert ever in Norway.
On 4 November 2005, the band released its eighth studio album, Analogue. The UK release of the single "Analogue" gave A-ha their first top-ten hit in the UK since 1988. The album includes a guest appearance by Graham Nash of Crosby Stills & Nash performing backup vocals on the songs "Over the Treetops" and "Cosy Prisons". The song "Celice" became the band's ninth to reach number one on a major national chart, and its music video sparked criticism for its sexual content. The tour for the album included a gig at London's Shepherd's Bush in February 2006, along with a TV special in Africa.
In 2006, A-ha recorded a cover of John Lennon's "No. 9 Dream" for Amnesty International. It was released in June 2007 on the album Make Some Noise. On 30 October 2006 in London, A-ha received the prestigious Q Magazine Inspiration Award for their long contribution to music and for inspiring many of their younger colleagues in the business. On 15 September 2007, A-ha played a free outdoor concert in Kiel, Germany, performing on a floating stage in the harbour. The concert was streamed live on the internet via MSN.
On 24 January 2009, 25 years after its first release and the 50th anniversary of the official hit list in Norway, A-ha won the Spellemann Award for VG-lista Hit of All Time for "Take On Me".


=== New direction and farewell (2008–2010) ===
On 20–22 May 2008, Harket, Furuholmen and Waaktaar performed concerts in Oslo to promote their respective solo material before coming together as A-ha to play "Train of Thought", "Take On Me", and two new songs, "Riding the Crest" and "Shadowside", which previewed the new A-ha album, Foot of the Mountain. These events led up to their performance at London's Royal Albert Hall on 24 May. On 24 April 2009, A-ha surprised their fan base by releasing their new single, "Foot of the Mountain", premiering that day on Norwegian radio. The single had been completed only the night before. The song is based upon the track "The Longest Night" by Furuholmen, which was released on his album A Dot of Black in the Blue of Your Bliss.  The band promoted the German release of the song by playing it during the final of Germany's Next Topmodel on 21 May at Cologne's Lanxess Arena. Foot of the Mountain, A-ha's ninth studio album, was released in Europe on 19 June 2009. The album's material marked a return to synth pop, similar to the band's earliest work, although the first single (and title track) was not wholly indicative of this. The band collaborated with successful producer Steve Osborne, who has produced albums for such artists as Suede, New Order, Starsailor, Doves, Elbow, and U2. "What There Is", an earlier solo track by Furuholmen, was re-recorded for the album.
The album entered the German album chart at number one, the UK album chart at number five and debuted on European Album Sales Chart at number eight. In January 2010, Foot of the Mountain was certified platinum in Germany. "I feel more connected to Depeche Mode (compared with other acts of the '80s)," claimed Furuholmen. A-ha performed a cover of Depeche Mode's "A Question of Lust" during a live performance for BBC Radio 2 – The Dermot O'Leary Show on 25 July 2009. On 24 July 2009, A-ha headlined the iTunes Live festival, the performance of which was made available for download on iTunes. In the Norwegian iTunes Store A-ha's release has yet to see the light of day. On 15 October 2009, the band announced they would disband after the 2010 worldwide Ending on a High Note Tour. The concert sold out on the first day of ticket sales as thousands of fans from at least 40 countries on six continents congregated to see A-ha for the last leg of the tour. Due to the large demand, a second farewell show was held for 3 December 2010.

To coincide with their disbandment, A-ha released The Singles: 1984–2004 in the US and re-released deluxe versions of their first two albums, as well as a third and final compilation album, a new live DVD and a re-release of the book The Swing of Things by Jan Omdahl. A new single titled "Butterfly, Butterfly" was revealed on 14 June 2010 and released as a single on 5 July to promote the double CD compilation 25.
On 6 July 2010, the albums Hunting High and Low and Scoundrel Days were released as deluxe editions in the US through Rhino Records, containing remixes, B-sides, demo versions, and extensive liner notes. Available in two-disc CD and digital versions (with additional material), both albums debuted in the Top 40 Billboard Top Internet Sales Chart, Hunting High and Low at number 34 and Scoundrel Days at number 36. Furuholmen revealed in an interview published in Magasinet (the magazine section of Norway's third largest newspaper, Dagbladet) that he suffers from atrial fibrillation. The news was picked up the same day by electronic music magazine Side-Line. At the 2011 Spellemannprisen, Norwegian artists from various music genres including Kaizers Orchestra, Ida Maria and Bertine Zetlitz, performed a cover of "The Sun Always Shines on TV" in honour of the band. After the performance, A-ha received the Honorary Award with the words "Our Heroes – Once upon a time, now – still and forever".
a-ha's final concerts in Oslo were recorded by ten HD cameras with digital, surround sound audio. Ending on a High Note Live, mixed by Toby Alington, is available in several formats, including the band's first Blu-ray release. A single-disc live album comprised sixteen tracks, while the Blu-ray, DVD, and deluxe-edition double-CD set comprised twenty tracks. A bonus documentary appears in the deluxe set and Blu-ray versions. An NTSC version was released in the US and Japan.
On 1 April 2011, A-ha released the DVD as well as the box-set containing both the DVD and the CD of their last concert, Ending on a High Note – The Final Concert. The Blu-ray of the concert was released on 11 April 2011. a-ha played at Oslo Spektrum on 21 August 2011, performing the song "Stay on These Roads" for a national memorial service dedicated to the victims of the 2011 Norway attacks.


=== Post-a-ha activities and anniversary releases (2011–2014) ===
After A-ha's break-up, Harket released two studio albums, Out of My Hands (2012) and Brother (2014).
Waaktaar released two songs. With New Jersey–based vocalist Jimmy Gnecco, he presented Weathervane as a new project in June 2011. Their self-titled single was included on the soundtrack for the movie Headhunters (based on the book Hodejegerne by Jo Nesbø). A second song, "Manmade Lake", had originally been planned for Foot of the Mountain but was released to Soundcloud in 2013.
In 2012, Furuholmen became a mentor on the show The Voice – Norges beste stemme. His mentee, Martin Halla, won the contest and had his first album produced by Furuholmen himself who is also an esteemed songwriter/producer for other artists. In 2014, Furuholmen agreed to compose the songs and supervise the recordings for the Norwegian film Beatles.


=== Second comeback (2015–2016) ===
During an A-ha fan convention in Oslo in October 2014, manager Harald Wilk announced plans to re-release A-ha's first five albums on vinyl and albums three through five as deluxe editions. In 2015, the band reunited to perform in Rock in Rio. A-ha in fact reunited for a two-year period and was writing new material. A-ha's tenth studio album, Cast in Steel, was released on 4 September 2015. The album was promoted with a European tour from March through May 2016. In March, they played a live concert that was broadcast on BBC Red Button and BBC Radio 2 as part of its "In Concert" series.
a-ha also performed at the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway. In Oslo Spektrum on 3 May 2016, A-ha collaborated with Void, a Norwegian computational computational design studio. The project resulted in a concert with advanced scenography using 360 virtual reality technology. The stereoscopic VR experience was made available for Android users directly through a YouTube app and for iPhone users and other platforms. The concept involved several motion detectors that reacted to the band's movements, voices and instruments. 3D cameras, 20,000 lines of code, 1,000 square meters of projection film and massive projectors were set up as a visual show that turned the Spektrum arena in Oslo into a light installation and visual experience that unfolded live for the audience instead of a pre-programmed sequence.


=== MTV Unplugged and tours (2017–2021) ===
 
An album and film from a series of acoustic performances, slated for June 2017, was scheduled for November 2017. In mid-June 2017, they recorded an MTV Unplugged special in the remote Norwegian island of Giske under close secrecy, with no phones or recording equipment allowed in the studio. In October 2017, an acoustic album titled Summer Solstice was released. It and included two new songs, "This Is Our Home" and "A Break in the Clouds". The video for "This Is Our Home" was released in September 2017, followed by the Unplugged versions of "The Sun Always Shines on T.V", "The Living Daylights" and "Take On Me", the last of which received widespread acclaim for re-imagining the pop classic. In early 2018, A-ha went on a European acoustic tour, which was first titled "An Acoustic Evening with A-ha" but then renamed "MTV Unplugged Tour 2018".
The acoustic version of "Take On Me" was included in the movie Deadpool 2, released in May 2018, and in episode 13, season 4 of the American TV series The Magicians. On 29 October 2019, A-ha started their Hunting High and Low tour in Dublin, Ireland, in which they played the whole of their debut album, in addition to other songs. The tour, scheduled to run through 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Concerts were scheduled for many European countries, South Africa, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and the United States. On the tour, the band presented the new song "Digital River".
On 13 June 2021, the documentary a-ha: The Movie premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. The movie tells the story of the band and deals with both their success and the problems, such as personal rifts between members. Director Thomas Robsahm followed the band for four years. It was released in countries worldwide.
The acoustic studio version of "Take On Me" was included in the American TV sitcom The Goldbergs on episode 16, season 8.


=== Touring and True North (2022–present) ===
In March 2022, A-ha resumed the Hunting High and Low tour after postponements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A new film and an album, both called True North, were released on 21 October 2022 on the Sony Music/RCA Records label. The recording was completed in November 2021 with the Norwegian Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra in Bodø, Norway. It is a filmed live performance and will also include scenic clips from Norway's nature, set in landscapes of northern Norway. The album's lead single, "I'm In", was released on 8 July 2022.
a-ha performed two of the album's songs on their 2022 tour: "Forest for the Trees" and "You Have What It Takes". A demo of "I'm In" and "You Have What It Takes" was previously posted on social media by Magne. The album's second single, "You Have What It Takes", was released on 16 September 2022. In 2023, in celebration of 65 years of the Hot 100, Billboard staff listed the 500 Best Pop Songs of All Time that graced the chart since 1958, with "Take On Me" at No. 26.


== Musical style and influences ==
A-ha's music has been described as synth-pop, new wave, and pop.
The band's primary musical influence was the Doors. Other influences include ABBA, the Bee Gees, David Bowie, Kraftwerk, and Roxy Music, along with synth-pop contemporaries such as Duran Duran, the Human League, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and Ultravox.


== Legacy ==
 
To date, the band is the most successful global pop-music act to have emerged from Norway. At its peak in the mid-1980s, the band achieved chart-topping success in Britain and the United States and was commercially successful in non-English-speaking areas of the world such as Germany, France and South America. In 1986, A-ha received eight MTV Video Music Awards during one award show. The music video for "Take On Me" is considered to be one of the most distinctive music videos from the 1980s. On 17 February 2020, the video became the fifth video from the 1980s and 1990s to reach 1 billion views on YouTube, following "November Rain" and "Sweet Child o' Mine" by Guns N' Roses, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana and Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody".
Songs by A-ha, either in original form or in the form of cover versions, have been included as background music and performances in episodes of popular television series, such as The Last of Us, Baywatch, Melrose Place, South Park, Smallville, Cougar Town, Private Practice and The Leftovers. The band recorded a James Bond theme song, "The Living Daylights", for the film of the same name. A-ha's music has also appeared in movies such as My Best Friend's Exorcism, One Night at McCool's, Grosse Pointe Blank and Corky Romano.
a-ha holds a Guinness World Record from 1991 for drawing the largest paying audience at a pop concert, with 198,000 people at the Estádio do Maracanã stadium in Rio de Janeiro. In 2006, the band was awarded the Q Awards Inspiration Award. Ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro, a poll made it clear that A-ha's 1991 appearance and their record audience number that year was what people remembered best and the highlight of the festival's 30-year history. As a result, A-ha were invited to reunite for a performance at the festival, celebrating 30 years since their debut album's release.
Several bands and artists have mentioned that they like A-ha, including Chris Martin of Coldplay, Sarah Brightman, Adam Clayton of U2, Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and Pitbull. Pitbull and Christina Aguilera performed the song "Feel This Moment", which interpolates "Take On Me", live at the MGM Grand during the 2013 Billboard Music Awards, with a surprise appearance from Harket. Harket and Furuholmen used their celebrity status to pioneer plug-in electric vehicles in Norway when, together with the environmental NGO Bellona, they imported a converted Fiat Panda and managed to get it registered. Their driving around in this car became local folklore and Robbie Andrew, a senior scientist working at Oslo’s CICERO Centre for International Climate Research, has argued that the Norwegian enthusiasm for electric cars and their favourable fiscal status can be traced back to this period.


== Awards and nominations ==

Following the success of their debut, the band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1986. A-ha have won eight MTV Video Music Awards: six for "Take On Me" and two for "The Sun Always Shines on TV". "Take On Me" was also nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Video at the American Music Awards of 1986. They also have won nine Spellemann Awards–the Norwegian equivalent of the Grammy Awards–including Spellemann of the Year in 1986.
In November 2012, all three bandmates were appointed Knights of the 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for their contribution to Norwegian music.

=== A-ha discography ===
The discography of A-ha, a Norwegian synthpop/rock band, consists of eleven studio albums, eight compilation albums, six box sets, ten extended plays, and fifty singles. This list does not include solo material or other projects recorded by A-ha band members.
A-ha was formed in 1982 by vocalist Morten Harket, guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy, and keyboardist Magne Furuholmen. The band moved to London and eventually signed with Warner Bros. Records. They released their debut album Hunting High and Low in 1985, which remains their biggest success and contained their international break-through hit song "Take On Me". The band has scored two top twenty US hits in their career, but has had several hit singles in many countries in Europe, South America and their native Norway. By 1993, the band had released five studio albums before going on hiatus the following year.
After a performance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, the band returned to the studio and recorded a new album, Minor Earth Major Sky, which was released in 2000. Their next album, Lifelines, was released in 2002, but would be their final album for Warner Bros. After signing to Polydor (part of Universal Music), further new albums were released in 2005 and 2009, after which the band decided to break up. However, they reformed for yet another new album, Cast in Steel, which was released in 2015. In 2022 they signed a one album deal with RCA/Sony Music and released the True North album in 2022. Harket, Furuholmen and Waaktaar-Savoy have been awarded Spellemannprisen 8 times. Through 2009 A-ha had sold over 100 million records worldwide. The band has released eleven studio albums, five compilations and four live albums.
In their native Norway, eight of the band's studio albums and eight of their singles have reached number one.

=== A-kinase-anchoring protein ===
The A-kinase anchoring proteins or A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) are a group of structurally diverse proteins, which have the common function of binding to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and confining the holoenzyme to discrete locations within the cell. At least 20 AKAPs have been cloned. There are at least 50 members, often named after their molecular mass.


== Function ==
AKAPs act as scaffold proteins wherein they bind PKA and other signaling proteins and physically tether these multi-protein complexes to specific locations, such as the nucleus, in cells. This allows specific targeting of substrates to be regulated by phosphorylation (by PKA) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases). The dimerization and docking (D/D) domain of the regulatory subunit dimer of PKA binds with the A-kinase binding (AKB) domain (an amphipathic helix) of AKAP. The AKAPs also bind other components, including; phosphodiesterases (PDEs) which break down cAMP, phosphatases which dephosphorylate downstream PKA targets and also other kinases (PKC and MAPK). Some AKAPs are able to bind both regulatory subunits (RI & RII) of PKA and are dual-specific AKAPs (D-AKAP1 and D-AKAP2).

=== A-law algorithm ===
An A-law algorithm is a standard companding algorithm, used in European 8-bit PCM digital communications systems to optimize, i.e. modify, the dynamic range of an analog signal for digitizing. It is one of the two companding algorithms in the G.711 standard from ITU-T, the other being the similar μ-law, used in North America and Japan.

The reason for this encoding is that the wide dynamic range of speech does not lend itself well to efficient linear digital encoding. A-law encoding effectively reduces the dynamic range of the signal, thereby increasing the coding efficiency and resulting in a signal-to-distortion ratio that is superior to that obtained by linear encoding for a given number of bits.


== Comparison to μ-law ==
The μ-law algorithm provides a slightly larger dynamic range than the A-law at the cost of worse proportional distortion for small signals. By convention, A-law is used for an international connection if at least one country uses it.

=== A-level ===
The A-level (Advanced Level) is a subject-based qualification conferred as part of the General Certificate of Education, as well as a school leaving qualification offered by the educational bodies in the United Kingdom and the educational authorities of British Crown dependencies to students completing secondary or pre-university education. They were introduced in England and Wales in 1951 to replace the Higher School Certificate. The A-level permits students to have potential access to a chosen university they applied to with UCAS points. They could be accepted into it should they meet the requirements of the university.
A number of Commonwealth countries have developed qualifications with the same name as and a similar format to the British A-levels. Obtaining an A-level, or equivalent qualifications, is generally required across the board for university entrance, with universities granting offers based on grades achieved. Particularly in Singapore, its A-level examinations have been regarded as being much more challenging than those in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.
A-levels are typically worked towards over two years. Normally, students take three or four A-level courses in their first year of sixth form, and most taking four cut back to three in their second year. This is because university offers are normally based on three A-level grades, and taking a fourth can have an impact on grades. Unlike other level-3 qualifications, such as the International Baccalaureate, A-levels have no specific subject requirements, so students have the opportunity to combine any subjects they wish to take. However, students normally pick their courses based on the degree they wish to pursue at university: most degrees require specific A-levels for entry.
In legacy modular courses (last assessment Summer 2019), A-levels are split into two parts, with students within their first year of study pursuing an Advanced Subsidiary qualification, commonly referred to as an AS or AS-level, which can either serve as an independent qualification or contribute 40% of the marks towards a full A-level award. The second part is known as an A2 or A2-level, which is generally more in-depth and academically rigorous than the AS. The AS and A2 marks are combined for a full A-level award. The A2-level is not a qualification on its own and must be accompanied by an AS-level in the same subject for certification.
A-level exams are a matriculation examination and can be compared to matura, the Abitur or the Baccalauréat.


== Current usage ==
Several countries use A-levels as a school-leaving qualification. The A-levels taken by students in other countries may differ from the A-levels taken in the United Kingdom.


=== International usage ===
Many schools in countries world-wide offer A-Levels through international cross-border exam boards, which include Cambridge International Education (CIE), Pearson Edexcel, and OxfordAQA.


=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh, the GCE AS and A-level are offered by Cambridge International Education (CIE) and Pearson Edexcel after completion of GCE O-level or IGCSE (CIE), and is conducted by the British Council. GCE Advanced Level qualifications are offered by some of the private, public, and international schools as an alternative to HSC (Higher Secondary School Certificate) offered by the Government Board of Education. It has become a popular choice among students, but due to financial implications, its reach is limited to the middle and upper classes in major cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong.


=== Brunei ===
In Brunei, the A-level qualification is offered, with examinations conducted by Cambridge International Education (CIE). Some subjects are unique to Brunei or have a format, curriculum, or syllabus that is unique to Brunei.


=== Cameroon ===
The Advanced Level of Cameroon is based on the Cambridge International Education and similarly, conducted by the government of Cameroon in collaboration with Cambridge University. All the courses taken are related to what the candidate is willing to pursue a career in university and these courses are on a recognizable international standard for university entrance; as they are major relevant courses. You can select between 3 and 5 courses during your advanced level studies, prior to taking your advanced level examination on which.


=== Hong Kong ===
The British A-level qualifications such as GCE A-level and International A-level are widely accepted in Hong Kong as an alternative to the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education for both admission and employment purposes. It is one of the most popular qualifications used for university admission via the non-JUPAS channel. For example, average non-JUPAS offers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology require one to three A*s (the mid-50% range). Since the introduction of the high distinction grade (A*) in 2010, the British A-level examination has regained its power to differentiate the very top levels of ability. According to the British Department for Education, in the academic year 2014/15, approximately 7.3%, 2.7%, 1.0%, and 0.3% of all the candidates from the GCSE cohort (548,480) achieved one to four A*s or a better result in the GCE A-level examination. This percentile rank is one important input for equating the levels in both examinations. On the sole basis of percentile ranks and the grade statistics from HKEAA in 2017, a score of 29/35 from the best five subjects in Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education is comparable to 1A*2A in the best three British A-levels, 32/35 to 2A*1A, 33/35 to 3A* and 34/35 to 4A*. In deriving inferences from these statistics, it is important to note that slightly more than a third of the GCSE candidates can go on to study in the sixth form before applying to universities via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) while almost all Hong Kong students can study Form 6 before sitting the HKDSE examination.
Relevant authorities such as the Hong Kong Examination and Assessment Authority (HKEAA) and UCAS also sought to connect the results from both exam systems to open doors for the holders of these qualifications who wish to study locally or overseas. Officially, the top distinction levels, A* in A-level and 5** in HKDSE, are currently recognized as broadly equivalent. In particular, in the light of statistical evidence, the 1% cut-off line is often set by admission offices at 2A*1A as compared to a score of 43/45 in the International Baccalaureate Diploma but the Uniform Mark Scale (UMS) instead of the letter grades would be used in many cases to offer a much more subtle view of the candidate's academic potential. Typical offers from Cambridge Medical School require 2A*1A and Oxford University Medical School require 1A*2A whereas those from the medical and dentistry schools of the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong require 4A* and 3A* respectively in A-level due to fierce competition.


=== Macau ===
The International Advanced Level qualifications are offered in some private schools and international schools which teaching medium is English and adopt IAL curriculum. Students in Macau can take the Cambridge exam board as well as the Edexcel exam board at their school. It is one of the most popular qualifications for the students who want to pursue their university study in UK, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand. International Advanced Level qualification is also accepted by Macau local universities for applying for direct admission, the applicants with IAL qualification are not required to take the Joint Admission Examination for Macao Four Higher Education Institution.


=== India ===
In India, Cambridge International Education (CIE), and Learning Resource Network (LRN) GCE Advanced Level qualifications are offered at private and international schools as an alternative to the conventional Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC).


=== Malaysia ===
In Malaysia, the A-level qualification is offered, with examinations conducted by Cambridge International Education (CIE). Some subjects are unique to Malaysia or have a format, curriculum, or syllabus that is unique to Malaysia. For instance, there are two types of A-level in Malaysia, Cambridge A-level (administered by Cambridge International Examinations) and Edexcel International Advanced Level (administered by Pearson Edexcel).


=== Mauritius ===

In Mauritius, A/AS-level qualifications are taken as part of the Higher School Certificate, awarded upon successful completion of secondary school after passing of examinations jointly administered by the Mauritius Examinations Syndicate and the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). Some exam papers offered, such as French, are customized to support the national educational standards. Additionally, International A-level qualifications from Edexcel are available, for which exams may be registered through the Mauritius Examinations Syndicate.


=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, A-level offered from Cambridge International Education (CIE) is the most popular and is presented by several public, private, and international institutions as an alternative to the National Examination Board (Nepal)'s 10+2 curriculum. A-level has become a popular choice for many students in Nepal. Besides A-level, International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement are also offered at this level. Nepali students generally appear for 4 subjects at A-level and 5 at AS-level.


=== Pakistan ===
A-levels are offered in Pakistan by governmental and private institutions, along with International Baccalaureate and other international examinations like the Advanced Placement. Examinations are handled by international British boards and the program is equivalent to Higher Secondary School Certificate. Cram Schools are established all around the country which prepares the students to take the examinations as private candidates.


=== Seychelles ===
In Seychelles, the A-level qualification is offered, with examinations conducted by Cambridge International Education (CIE). Some subjects are unique to Seychelles or have a format, curriculum, or syllabus that is unique to Seychelles.


=== Singapore ===

In Singapore, H1/H2/H3 level qualifications are awarded upon successful completion of examinations jointly administered by Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE), Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) and the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). Singaporean A-levels are notably much more difficult than the British A-levels but a little bit easier than the Hong Kong A-level Examination in terms of the proportion of students achieving the highest grades, as part of the country's wider robust educational policy.


=== Sri Lanka ===

In Sri Lanka, A-level qualifications are offered by governmental and non-governmental schools (Private Schools). The qualifications are awarded upon successful completion of examinations called Local A-levels while most of the private schools award them upon London A-levels. Local GCE Advanced Level qualifications are offered by the Department of Examinations. Private Schools (International Schools) in Sri Lanka provide A-level qualifications which are offered by:

Cambridge International Education (CIE)
Edexcel
Passing A-levels is a major requirement for applying to local universities and for private universities in Sri Lanka. In the recent past, Universities in Sri Lanka have given the opportunity to apply for their foundation courses which only require O-level (Ordinary Level) results.


=== Tanzania ===
A-level is an education structure after the completion of 11 years of Universal Primary Education (UPE). Universal Primary Education consists of two levels, the primary school level of seven years and ordinarily secondary level, of four years.
Students are then required to sit for the National Examination which is done on a specific month in a certain year. The exams are done throughout the country on the same date provided by the examination board. Examinations will depend on the cluster and core subjects in which a student shall take. There are three major clusters, namely science, business, and liberal arts plus core subjects of which are seven in total or more. Students who will then pass according to the National Examination Standards shall be selected to join Advanced Secondary Education and are selected according to the subjects they passed the most and by their will to pursue certain subjects.
There are only three core subjects to study in Advanced Level and one or more optional subjects to sit for the Advanced Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (ACSEE). Then students are awarded Advanced Certificate of Secondary Education only if they have passed. The pass marks are arranged according to grades and the grades will determine whether a student will qualify to join tertiary education.
A-level education is a two years education which is offered by the government and non-government schools. It is regulated by the Ministry of Education which assures both qualitative and quantitative subject matters and there is a special independent council that is responsible in composing the Advanced Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (ACSEE) namely The National Examination Council of Tanzania (NECTA).


=== Uganda ===
In Uganda, a Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education is awarded to students who have passed their national examinations that are set and marked by the Uganda National Examination Board (UNEB). It is among the requirements for one to join a university in Uganda. The advanced level takes two years for one to complete.


=== United Kingdom ===

A-levels are a college or sixth form leaving qualification offered in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. These are not compulsory, unlike GCSEs. In Scotland, A-levels are also offered by some schools as an alternative school-leaving qualification in place of the Scottish Advanced Higher. The main examination boards which administer British A-levels in the UK are:

Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA)
Oxford, Cambridge, and RSA Examinations (OCR)
Edexcel (Edexcel Pearson – London Examinations)
Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC)
Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment (CCEA)
Cambridge International Education (CIE)
Learning Resource Network (LRN)
Oxford AQA, Edexcel, Cambridge International Education (CIE), and Learning Resource Network (LRN) also offer international versions of the British A-levels in the United Kingdom and worldwide.
The British variant of A/AS-levels is also taken in many Commonwealth and former Commonwealth countries, as well as in examination centers worldwide. British international schools in foreign countries generally offer the British A-levels as offered through Edexcel or Cambridge International Examinations. At select examination centers, the British A-level exams may also be available to private candidates.


==== Subjects offered ====

A wide variety of subjects are offered at A-level by the five exam boards. Although exam boards often alter their curricula, this table shows the majority of subjects that are consistently available for study. 


==== A-level reforms in England ====
Between 2015 and 2018 (first assessment Summer 2017), A-levels in England were reformed, transitioning from a modular to linear structure (initially across 13 subjects). This means all A-level exams are taken in one sitting as a set of terminal exams (three exams for the majority of subjects), and there is no coursework set for many subjects. For A-levels that retain a coursework element, the percentage of the final grade determined by coursework has been reduced. An example of this can be seen in Edexcel's new English Literature A-level, reformed in 2015, which reduces the amount of coursework to 20% (from 40% in the old modular specification). A-levels are no longer separated into units, and students must resit all of their exams if they wish to resit the qualification. While these reforms were expected to be complete for first teaching in 2017, this was extended to 2018 to include the reforms of less common languages such as Modern Hebrew and Bengali.
The AS-level is now a separate qualification and is not required for an A-level award, although it still encompasses the first year of the full A-level content. However, unlike AS-levels in the old modular courses, they are now worth only 40% as many UCAS points as a full A-level (from 50% in the modular courses), as content from the second year of A-level is considered more academically challenging than that of the first year.
As these reforms took place in stages, many students took a combination of modular and linear courses before all reforms were complete, with AS-levels still being part of an A-level in older modular courses.
These reforms look to combat grade inflation, where the proportion of students achieving the highest grades increases year upon year, causing the value of those grades to be eroded. The modular system has also been criticised for nurturing a 'resit culture', while new linear courses give no opportunity to resit individual units.
Controversially, some A-level course subjects have been abolished since 2017 as part of these reforms. These include archaeology, anthropology, creative writing, critical thinking, general studies, and home economics. Many universities criticized the scrapping of exams taken at the end of AS-level, which used to be worth 50% of the overall A-level grade. This is because the universities used the grades achieved at AS-level (available to universities after a student applies during the second year of A-levels) as an indication of a student's ability and thus whether to give said student an offer.
Opposition to these reforms in Wales and Northern Ireland has resulted in maintaining the modular structure of their qualification.
In September 2023, it was announced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that the A-level would be scrapped in England and merged with T-levels to form the Advanced British Standard, however this was cancelled by the Labour government after their victory in the 2024 general election.


=== Zimbabwe ===
The GCE Advanced Level qualification is offered by the Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (ZIMSEC). Before, this qualification was jointly offered by Cambridge International Education and the Council in Zimbabwe.


== Former usage ==


=== Caribbean ===
In 2002, there has been a move away from the GCE Advanced Level to the CXC CAPE examinations, making them a de facto university entrance examination. Some universities also require applicants to take separate entrance examinations. The International Baccalaureate and European Baccalaureate are also accepted.

=== A-level (United Kingdom) ===
The A-level (Advanced Level) is a main school leaving qualification of the General Certificate of Education in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. It is available as an alternative qualification in other countries, where it is similarly known as an A-Level.
Students generally study for A-levels over a two-year period. For much of their history, A-levels have been examined by written exams taken at the end of these two years. A more modular approach to examination became common in many subjects starting in the late 1980s, and standard for September 2000 and later cohorts, with students taking their subjects to the half-credit "AS" level after one year and proceeding to full A-level the next year (sometimes in fewer subjects). In 2015, Ofqual decided to change back to a terminal approach where students sit all examinations at the end of the second year. AS is still offered, but as a separate qualification; AS grades no longer count towards a subsequent A-level.
Most students study three or four A-level subjects simultaneously during the two post-16 years (ages 16–18) in a secondary school, in a sixth form college, in a further and higher education college, or in a tertiary college, as part of their further education.
A-levels are recognised by many universities as the standard for assessing the suitability of applicants for admission in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and many such universities partly base their admissions offers on a student's predicted A-level grades, with the majority of these offers conditional on achieving a minimum set of final grades.


== History ==
A-levels were introduced in 1951 as a standardised school-leaving qualification, replacing the Higher School Certificate. The examinations were taken on a subject-by-subject basis, the subjects being chosen according to the strengths and interests of the student. This encouraged specialization and in-depth study of three to four subjects. At first, A-levels were graded as simply distinction, pass or fail (although students were given an indication of their marks, to the nearest 5%). Candidates obtaining a distinction originally had the option to sit a scholarship level paper on the same material, to attempt to win one of 400 national scholarships. The scholarship level was renamed the S-Level in 1963.
Quite soon, rising numbers of students taking the A-level examinations required more differentiation of achievement below the S-Level standard. Grades were therefore introduced, with recommendations by the Secondary School Examinations Council (SSEC) of approximate proportions of pupils for each grade.

The O grade was equivalent to a GCE Ordinary Level pass which indicated a performance equivalent to the lowest pass grade at Ordinary Level.
Over time, the validity of this system was questioned because, rather than reflecting a standard, norm referencing simply maintained a specific proportion of candidates at each grade, which in small cohorts was subject to statistical fluctuations in standards. In 1984, the government's Secondary Examinations Council decided to replace the norm referencing with criterion referencing: grades would in future be awarded on examiner judgement thus eliminating a possible inadequacy of the existing scheme.
The criterion referencing scheme came into effect for the summer 1987 exams as the system set examiners specific criteria for the awarding of B and E grades to candidates, and then divided out the other grades according to fixed percentages. Rather than awarding an Ordinary Level for the lowest pass, a new "N" (for Nearly passed) was introduced. Criticisms of A-level grading continued, and when Curriculum 2000 was introduced, the decision was made to have specific criteria for each grade, and the 'N' grade was abolished.
In 1989, Advanced Supplementary (AS) awards were introduced; they were intended to broaden the subjects a pupil studied post 16, and were to complement rather than be part of a pupil's A-level studies. AS-Levels were generally taken over two years, and in a subject the pupil was not studying at A-Level. Each AS level contained half the content of an A-Level, and at the same level of difficulty.
Initially, a student might study three subjects at A-Level and one at AS-Level, or often even four subjects at A-Level. However, due to decreasing public spending on education over time, a growing number of schools and sixth form colleges would now arrange for their pupils to study for three A-Levels instead of four.
A-levels evolved gradually from a two-year linear course with an exam at the end, to a modular course, between the late 1980s and 2000. By the year 2000 there was a strong educational reason to standardise the exam and offer greater breadth to students through modules and there was also a pragmatic case based on the inefficiency of linear courses where up to 30% of students were failing to complete or pass.
Curriculum 2000 was introduced in September 2000, with the first new examinations taken in January and June of the following year. The Curriculum 2000 reforms also replaced the S-Level extension paper with the Advanced Extension Award.
The Conservative Party under Prime Minister David Cameron initiated reforms for A-levels to change from modular to the current linear structure. British Examination Boards (Edexcel, AQA and OCR) regulated and accredited by the government of the United Kingdom responded to the government's reform announcements by modifying specifications of several A-level subjects.
On 18 March 2020, A-level examinations were cancelled in order to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic. The A-level and AS-level qualifications would instead be awarded based upon a mix of teacher assessment and informal "mock" exams taken earlier in the school year. This led to a grading controversy.
On 6 January 2021, Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson confirmed that the 2020/21 series of A-levels would also be cancelled, pending further arrangements by Ofqual and the Department for Education.


== Curriculum ==


=== Structure ===
Prior to the 2015 government reforms of the A-level system, A-levels had (since the Curriculum 2000 reforms) consisted of two equally weighted parts: AS (Advanced Subsidiary) Level, usually assessed in the first year of study, and "A2 Level", usually assessed in the second year of study. It was also possible to take both AS Levels and A2 Levels for a subject in the same examination session - this was most common with Mathematics and Further Mathematics, where a student may have completed the entire Mathematics A-Level in their first year of study, followed by the entire Further Mathematics A-Level in their second. It was typical for an AS course to comprise two or three modules, with the A2 half of the course comprising two or three modules, for a total of four or six modules. The modules within each part may have been equally weighted, or be of varying weights. Modules were either assessed by externally marked papers, or by school-assessed, externally moderated coursework.
Following the reforms, A-Levels and AS-Levels have been decoupled, with AS-Level results no longer counting towards the A-Level qualification. The AS-Level consists of the first half of the A-Level course, and can be taught alongside the first year of the full A-Level course. Grades are determined by adding up the mark for each component (which is sometimes weighted) and applying a grade boundary.


=== Subjects offered ===

A wide variety of subjects are offered at A-level by the five exam boards. Although exam boards often alter their curricula, this table shows the majority of subjects which are consistently available for study. See a list of, click on the "show" below, Advanced Level Subjects (usually referred to as A-Level):


=== Studying ===
The number of A-level exams taken by students can vary. A typical route is to study four subjects at AS level and then drop down to three at A2 level, although some students continue with their fourth subject. Three is usually the minimum number of A-levels required for university entrance, with some universities specifying the need for a fourth AS subject. There is no limit set on the number of A-levels one can study, and a number of students take five or more A-levels. It is permissible to take A-levels in languages one already speaks fluently, or courses with overlapping content, even if not always fully recognized by universities. There are many options that are in place for students to choose to do coursework.


=== Grading ===
The pass grades for A-levels are, from highest to lowest, A*, A, B, C, D and E. Those who do not reach the minimum standard required for a grade E receive the non-grade U (unclassified), and those who fail to complete any of the subject's components will receive an X. There is no A* grade at AS level.
The process to decide these grades for modular A-levels involves the uniform mark scheme (UMS). Under this scheme, four-module A-levels have a maximum mark of 400 UMS (or 200 UMS each for AS and A2), and six-module A-levels have a maximum mark of 600 (or 300 UMS each for AS and A2). The maximum UMS within AS and A2 may be split unequally between each modules. For example, a Physics AS may have two exam modules worth 90 UMS and 150 UMS, and a coursework module worth 60 UMS. The 'raw marks' i.e. actual score received on a test may differ from UMS awarded. On each assignment, the correspondence of raw marks to UMS is decided by setting grade boundaries, a process which involves consultation by subject experts and consideration of statistics, aiming to keep standards for each grade the same year on year. Achieving less than 40% results in a U (unclassified). For passing grades, 40% corresponds to an E grade, 50% a D, 60% a C, 70% a B, and 80% an A. The A* grade was introduced in 2010 and is awarded to candidates who average 80% UMS across all modules, with a score over 90% UMS in all A2 modules. In Mathematics, which comprises six 100 UMS modules, only the C3 and C4 modules count towards this requirement. In Further Mathematics and Additional Further Mathematics, where more than three A2 modules can be taken, the three best-scoring A2 modules count.


=== International comparisons ===


==== Wales and Northern Ireland ====
Recent research and the corresponding findings have shown that over a time span of several years students from Northern Ireland outperformed students from England and Wales in A-level examinations.


==== Hong Kong ====
According to UCAS and HKEAA, the Hong Kong A-level examination has historically been benchmarked against the UK A-levels. In general, a UK A grade is broadly equivalent to a Hong Kong A-C grade. This conclusion is based mainly on the percentage of pupils achieving the respective grades in respective exams. In the UK, on average 25% of participants of each subject achieved an A grade every year, compared to the 25% A-C rate in Hong Kong – A(4%), A-B (10%), A-C (25%). According to the BBC, the percentage of students achieving an A* is about 8–10%, which essentially lies within the A-B range of their Hong Kong counterparts in respective subjects.


==== United States ====
In the United States of America the high school diploma is the qualification generally required for entry into colleges and universities. Students are usually evaluated and granted admission to US higher education institutions based on a combination of school marks, via a transcript from their high school, and a college entrance exam, most commonly the SAT or ACT.
In the United Kingdom, the high school diploma is considered to be at the level of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which is awarded at Year 11. For college and university admissions, the high school diploma may be accepted in lieu of the GCSE if an average grade of C is obtained in subjects with a GCSE counterpart.
As the more academically rigorous A-levels awarded at Year 13 are expected for university admission, the high school diploma alone is generally not considered to meet university requirements. Students who wish to study in the United Kingdom may additionally participate in the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) programs, which are considered to be at the level of the A-level qualifications and earn points on the UCAS Tariff, or may opt to take A-level examinations in British international schools or as private candidates. College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) tests, such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, or the ACT, may also be considered.
The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) recommends that in addition to a high school diploma, grades of 3 or above in at least two, or ideally three, Advanced Placement exams may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission. The IB Diploma may also be accepted. For the College Entrance Examination Board tests, a minimum score of 600 or higher in all sections of the SAT or a minimum score of 26 or higher in all sections of the ACT along with a minimum score of 600 in relevant SAT Subject Tests may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.


=== Special educational needs ===
The Equality Act says that exam boards are required to take ‘such steps as it is reasonable to have to take to avoid the disadvantage’, meaning that they are required to make reasonable adjustments for students who would otherwise be at a substantial disadvantage when demonstrating their skills,
knowledge and understanding in an assessment. For students taking GCE A-level examinations with learning difficulties, an injury/repetitive strain injury (RSI) or other disabilities, some of the access arrangements offered are:

Extra time (the most common approved is 25%, but the amount depends on the severity of the disability, and the student's processing speed. It can be allowed for: disorders such as ADHD, Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, or any other disabilities that affect the student's processing speed, an injury that affects the time needed in the exam, or learning in English as a second language provided that the student has been studying in the UK for not more than 2 years)
An amanuensis (somebody types or handwrites as the student dictates; this is normally used when the student cannot write due to an injury or disability)
A word processor (without any spell checking tools) can be used by students who have trouble writing legibly or who are unable to write quickly enough to complete the exam within the time limit
A different format exam paper (large print, Braille, printed on coloured paper, etc.)
A 'reader' (a teacher/exam invigilator can read out the words written on the exam, but they cannot explain their meaning)
A different room (sometimes due to a disability a student can be placed in a room by themselves or with selected others; this also happens when an amanuensis is used, so as not to disturb the other candidates. All exam rooms are covered by separate dedicated invigilators.)
Access arrangements must be approved by the exam board concerned. There are others available, but these are the most commonly used.


=== Examination boards ===
A-level examinations in the UK are currently administered through 5 examination boards: AQA, OCR, Edexcel (London Examinations), WJEC/Eduqas and CCEA. The present 5 can trace their roots via a series of mergers or acquisitions to one or more of the originally 9 GCE Examination boards. Additionally, there are four examination boards offering A-level qualifications internationally: OxfordAQA, Edexcel, Learning Resource Network (LRN) and the CIE. OCR and CIE are both branches of the parent organization, Cambridge Assessment. OxfordAQA is a partnership between AQA and Oxford University Press. In the UK it is customary for schools to register with multiple examination boards and to "mix and match" A-levels to get a combined curriculum that fits the school profile.
The exam boards finance themselves through the fees charged to the schools for administering the examination. In addition to the centre registration fee, A-level Mathematics will raise £120.00 per student, while Biology, Physics and Chemistry £90.00 per subject and languages such as Spanish, French and German £100.00 or £201.15 depending on the syllabus. (2019-20 AQA figures)  


== Usage ==


=== England, Wales and Northern Ireland ===
A-levels are usually studied by students in Sixth Form, which refers to the last two years of secondary education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, taken at ages 16–18. Some secondary schools have their own Sixth Form, which admits students from lower year groups, but will often accept external applications. There are also many specialist Sixth Form and Further Education Colleges which admit from feeder schools across a large geographic area.  Admission to A-level programmes is at the discretion of providers, and usually depends on GCSE grades. A typical requirement would be 5 A*-C grades at GCSE, although requirements can be higher, particularly for independent schools and grammar schools.


=== Scotland ===
A-levels are offered as an alternate qualification by a small number of educational institutions in Scotland, in place of the standard Scottish Higher, and the Advanced Higher levels of the Scottish Qualifications Certificate. The schools that offer A-levels are mainly private fee-paying schools particularly for students wishing to attend university in England.


=== International schools ===
Many international schools choose to use the British system for their wide recognition. Furthermore, students may choose to sit the papers of British examination bodies at education centres around the world, such as those belonging to the British Council. According to the British Council, A-levels are similar to the American Advanced Placement courses which are themselves equivalent to first-year courses of America's four-year bachelor's degrees.


=== University admissions ===
A-level students often apply to universities before they have taken their final exams, with applications administered centrally through UCAS. British universities (including Scottish universities, which receive many applicants taking A-levels) consider GCSEs, AS-level results, predicted A-level results, and extracurricular accomplishments when deciding whether applicants should be made an offer through UCAS. These offers may be 'unconditional', guaranteeing a place regardless of performance in A2 examinations. Far more often, the offers are conditional on A-level grades, and become void should the student fail to achieve the marks expected by the university (for example, conditional offer of three A-levels at grades B-B-C). Universities may specify which subjects they wish these grades to be in (for example, conditional offer of grades A-A-B with a grade A in Mathematics). The offer may include additional requirements, such as attaining a particular grade in the Sixth Term Examination Paper. The university is obliged to accept the candidate if the conditions are met, but is not obliged to reject a candidate who misses the requirements. Leniency may in particular be shown if the candidate narrowly misses grades.
A-level grades are also sometimes converted into numerical scores, typically UCAS tariff scores. Under the new UCAS system starting in 2017, an A* grade at A-level is worth 56 points, while an A is worth 48, a B is worth 40, a C is worth 32, a D is 24, and a E is worth 16; so a university may instead demand that an applicant achieve 112 points, instead of the equivalent offer of B-B-C. This allows greater flexibility to students, as 112 points could also, for example, be achieved through the combination A-B-D, which would not have met the requirements of a B-B-C offer because of the D grade.
Depending on the specific offer made, a combination of more than 3 subjects (typically 4 or 5) with lower grades, or points from non-academic input such as higher level music grades or a Key Skills course, may also be accepted by the university. The text of the offer determines whether this flexibility is available – "112 UCAS Points" likely would, while "112 UCAS Points from three A-level subjects" would not.


=== International variants ===
There are currently three examination boards which provide an international variant of the United Kingdom A-level examinations to international students. These are Cambridge International Examinations (CIE), Edexcel and OxfordAQA.

== Criticism and controversy ==


=== Grade inflation ===
The most common criticism of the A-level system is an accusation of grade inflation. The press have noted the steady rise in average grades for several consecutive years and drawn the conclusion that A-levels are becoming consistently easier. A 2007 report by Robert Coe compared students' scores in the ALIS ability test with equivalent grades achieved in A-level exams over a period of approximately 20 years; he found that students of similar ability were achieving on average about 2 grades higher than in the past. In the case of maths it was nearer to 3.5 grades higher.
The government and teaching bodies maintain that the improved grades represent higher levels of achievement due to improved and more experienced teaching methods, but some educationalists and journalists argue that the change is due to grade inflation and the examinations getting easier. It has also been suggested that government pressure on schools to achieve high examination results has led them to coach students to pass the examination rather than understand the subject. In 2000, the A-level system was changed to examine students at the end of each of the two years of A-level study, rather than only at the end of the two years. The results of the first year's exam (AS-level) allowed students to drop subjects they find difficult after one year and to retake AS examinations to achieve a higher grade at that level. The availability to resit the AS paper, with the best mark contributing to the full A level, has improved results of the A level. Some believe that students are tending to select easier subjects in order to achieve higher grades.
Universities in Britain have complained that the increasing number of A grades awarded makes it hard to distinguish between students at the upper end of the ability spectrum. Many universities administer their own entrance tests such as the BMAT and LNAT for specific courses, or conduct interviews to select applicants. In 2005, the head of admissions at the University of Cambridge outlined changes he believed should be made to the current system, particularly the use of the Advanced Extension Awards, a more challenging qualification based on the more advanced content of the A-level syllabus. More universities have wanted to see applicants' individual module results to see how comfortably they have achieved their result due to fears that the A-level might not offer an accurate test of ability, or that it is a good prediction of future academic success.
In 2002, allegations that students had been given lower marks than they deserved in order to fix overall results and make the pass rate seem lower than it had been in previous years were raised. The Tomlinson Inquiry was set up to ascertain whether this was an underhand way to disprove that A-levels were becoming too easy. As a result, some papers were re-marked but only 1,220 A-level and 733 AS-level students saw an improvement to their results.
To replace the cancelled summer 2020 examination series (owing to concerns over the spread of COVID-19), grades were awarded using centre-assessed grades and rankings.  These were initially moderated by Ofqual but, owing to numerous problems, candidates' final grades reverted to those supplied by centres.  This resulted in significant grade inflation, with initial calculations showing around 37.7% of candidates gaining a grade A or A*, compared with 25.2% in 2019.


=== Reforms ===
In response to concerns shown by employers and universities that it was not possible to distinguish exceptional candidates among the large number of students achieving A grades, and in order to mirror GCSE standards, a higher "super A" grade (like the A* grade at GCSE) was proposed in 2004. It was generally agreed that bringing in higher grades would be a better idea than raising the grade boundaries to keep the standards consistent, and it was proposed that on top of the A, an A* grade should be available at A-level in order to stretch the most able students while ensuring others are not disadvantaged. For modular A2 exams sat from 2010 onwards, the highest A-level grade is A*, requiring an A grade overall and 90% overall average UMS in A2 papers.
The 2004 reform of the Mathematics syllabus, following calls that it was too hard, attracted criticism. In the change, content consisting of three modules (Pure 1–3) was spread to four modules (Core 1–4). It was alleged that this made the course easier as students did less work for the same qualifications. Further reforms in 2006 to make the Mathematics syllabus more popular were met with mixed opinions. Supporters cited it would reverse the downward trend in students taking the subject whilst others were concerned that the subject was "still incredibly difficult".
Despite ongoing work to improve the image of A-levels in the business community, a number of business leaders expressed concern about the suitability of the qualification for school leavers and to urge the adoption of the International Baccalaureate in the UK as an alternative qualification at schools. Examples of concerns were those raised in 2009 by Sir Mike Rake, Chairman of BT Group, Sir Terry Leahy, Chairman of Tesco and by Sir Christopher Gent, Chairman of GlaxoSmithKline. Some schools have also moved to offering the Cambridge Pre-U as an alternative to A-levels and with higher tariffs.


=== Burden of assessment ===
With increased modularisation of subjects, the amount of time that young adults are spending being examined in the UK has risen considerably. It was estimated in a report by educationalists that by the age of 19 children will have spent an entire year of their school education being assessed. As a result of such criticisms about the "burden of assessment", since candidates have taken four papers for most A-levels, instead of six as in the past. This means that there are two modules for AS and two more for A2 for the majority of A-levels. However, this will not be the case for all A-levels: Biology, Human Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Electronics, Geology, Music, Welsh and Science will continue with six units, three units for AS and A2 respectively, and 600 UMS for the A-level. Mathematics (including Further Mathematics, Additional Further Mathematics, Statistics, and the Use of Mathematics AS), will not change structurally in the modular reform; it will stay on 600 UMS (300 UMS for AS), but it will include the new A* grade and the 'Stretch and Challenge' provision. Also, Bengali, Modern Hebrew, Punjabi, Polish, Arabic, Japanese, Modern Greek, Biblical Hebrew, Dutch, Gujarati, Persian, Portuguese, and Turkish will remain at two units, one for AS and one for A2. However, they will move to 200 UMS for A-level. Chinese will also move to 200 UMS, but instead of two units, it will move to three units: AS will have two units, A2 will have one. It is the first A-level to have an odd number of units since Curriculum 2000.

Cambridge University has warned that it is extremely unlikely that it will accept applicants who are taking two or more supposedly 'softer' A-level subjects out of 3. It has outlined a list of subjects it considers to be 'unsuitable', which includes Accounting, Design and Technology, Film Studies, Information and Communication Technology, Media Studies, Photography, and Sports studies.
As a result of dislike of the modular system, many schools now offer the alternative International Baccalaureate Diploma qualification. The course offers more subjects, extracurricular activity, a philosophical epistemological component known as "Theory of Knowledge", as well as the requirement of an extended essay on any subject of a candidate's choice. Unlike the current AS/A2 system, the International Baccalaureate is not based on a modular system. The Diploma Programme, administered by the International Baccalaureate, is a recognised pre-university educational programme.
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested in 2013 that one state school in every county should offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme as an alternative to A-levels.


=== Breadth of study ===
The A-level has been criticised for providing less breadth since many A-level students do not generally study more than three subjects in their final year.[18] A major part of this criticism is that, while a three- or four-subject curriculum can be balanced across the spectrum—for example, students may choose one science subject (e.g. Maths, Chemistry, or Biology), a language subject (e.g. English Language, English Literature, French, German, Spanish), and a "creative" subject (e.g. Art Studies)—in many cases students choose three closely linked subjects—for example, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry or Sociology, Psychology, and Politics. This is in part due to university entrance requirements, which, for degree programs such as medicine, may require three related A-level subjects, but non-traditional combinations are becoming more common ("British Council Australia Education UK"). Thus, while the purpose of Curriculum 2000 was to encourage students to undertake contrasting subjects, to broaden their 'skill-base', there is a tendency to pursue similar disciplines. However, others disagree, arguing that the additional AS-level(s) studied would already have provided more breadth compared with the old system.


=== Predicted grading ===
Students applying to universities before receiving their A-level results typically do so on the basis of predicted grades, which are issued by schools and colleges. A student's predicted grades usually depend on their GCSE results, performance throughout the course, performance in tests and mock examinations, or a combination of these factors.
A possible reformation would be something called the post-qualifications applications system (PQA), where applicants apply to university after they receive their results. It has been argued that this would be fairer to applicants, especially those from lower-income families whose results were thought to be under-predicted. However, a more recent UCAS report shows that although the reliability of predicted grades declines in step with family income, this can still lead to an over-prediction effect for lower income groups. Just 45% of predicted grades are accurate – 47% are over-predictions and 9% under-predictions. A recent UCAS consultation rejected the implementation of PQA following opposition from universities, schools and awarding bodies.


=== Effects of COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 and 2021 ===

In 2020 the A-level system was challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ofqual advised that the 2020 A-level exams should be cancelled, students be given a completion certificate, and universities widen the intake relying on a higher drop-out. The government intervened and grades were to be awarded using an algorithm. There was a public outcry, explained Roger Taylor the former chair of Ofqual who resigned. It was a “colossal error of judgment”: awarding grades calculated by algorithm was not acceptable to the public. Instead the final grades were awarded by teacher assessment, a system that was repeated in 2021. Taylor explained the algorithm was robust, it was the way it was being used that caused the problem: that was down to human decisions. LSE and UCL researchers showed that teacher assessment gave a 15% advantage to students with graduate parents.

=== A-line (clothing) ===
An A-line skirt is a skirt that is fitted at the hips and gradually widens towards the hem, giving the impression of the shape of a capital letter A. The term is also used to describe dresses and coats with a similar shape.


== History ==
The term was first used by the French couture designer Christian Dior as the label for his collection of spring 1955. The  A-Line collection's feature item, then the "most wanted silhouette in Paris", was a "fingertip-length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full, pleated skirt".
Although an A-shape, this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A-line idea. That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Dior's successor, Yves Saint Laurent, with his "Trapeze Line" of spring 1958, which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line.
A-line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s, disappeared from fashion almost completely by the early 1980s and were revived by the retro trend of the late 1990s. By that time, "A-line" was used more loosely to describe any dress wider at the hips than at the bust or waist, as well as a number of flared skirt styles. "True" A-line shapes on the pattern of Dior and Saint Laurent saw a revival in the early 2000s.


== Style details ==
The A-line skirt has no visible embellishments for ease, such as pleats or slits, but is fitted to the upper hip by means of seams and/or darts. However, denim A-line skirts often have buttons down the center seam. Its fastening is usually kept discreet, with a side or back zipper. A belt is sometimes used. Pockets may be present, but not usually. It can be cut at any length.
When referring to dresses and coats, the term A-line generally means fitted from the shoulders to the hips and then widening to the hem, but it is also sometimes used to mean widening from the shoulders to the hem, ignoring the waist and hips.
It is often used to describe a popular style of wedding dress, which is fitted above and around the hips but flares gently to the hem, giving a streamlined and quite slim look.

=== A-list ===
An A-list actor is a major movie star, or one of the most bankable actors in a film industry.
The A-list is part of a larger guide called The Hot List, which ranks the bankability of 1,400 movie actors worldwide, and has become an industry-standard guide in Hollywood. American entertainment journalist James Ulmer, the guide's creator, has also developed a version including directors, the Hot List of Directors. The Ulmer scale categorizes the lists into A+, A, B+, B, C, and D listings. Similarly, in India, there is three-tier strategy, tier-1, tier-2 and tier-3, which are based on the saleability and box office collection capability of a star.


== Popular usage ==
In popular usage outside the film industry, an A-list celebrity is any person with an admired or desirable social status. Even socialites with popular press coverage and elite associations have been termed as A-list celebrities. Similarly, less popular persons and current teen idols are referred to as B-list celebrities – and the ones with lesser fame as C-list ones. In 2000, Entertainment Weekly interpreted a C-list celebrity as "that guy (or sometimes that girl), the easy-to-remember but hard-to-name character actor".
The D-list is for someone whose celebrity is so obscure that they are generally only known for appearances as celebrities on panel game shows and reality television. In the late 20th century, D-listers were largely ignored by the news industry; for example, Paul Lynde, by this point in his career best known for being on the daytime game show Hollywood Squares, went largely unnoticed by the supermarket tabloids, and his homosexuality (which would have drawn attention for bigger celebrities) went largely unreported. Kathy Griffin, an American comedian who became widely known for her frequent appearances on such programs, used the term in a tongue-in-cheek manner for her 2005 TV special The D-List and her 2005 TV series Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List. The term "D-list" is derived from the lowest rating used for the Ulmer scale. Other successive letters of the alphabet beyond D, as in the terms E-list and Z-list, are sometimes used for exaggeration or comic effect but effectively have the same meaning as D-list.

=== A-magasinet ===
A-magasinet is a supplement to the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten that is published every Friday. The supplement is published in a format of 210 by 278 millimeters (8.3 by 10.9 in), and it is therefore smaller than the daily newspaper, which is published in tabloid format. The supplement is printed at the press Hjemmet Mortensen Trykkeri and its number of pages has ranged from 68 to 84. Until 2001, the supplement was printed by the press Aktietrykkeriet in Fetsund.


== History ==
A-magasinet was issued during three periods: from 1926 to 1943, from 1963 to 1993, and from 2005 onward.
The first issue was published on New Year's eve in 1926 at the initiative of editor Frøis Frøisland. The name of the publication was selected in a contest among the readers of Aftenposten. Other suggestions for naming the publication included Lørdagshygga ('Saturday cosiness'), Ding Dong, Sofadyret ('couch creature'), and Tilhænger'n ('trailer', after Harald Madsen of the popular comic pair Ole & Axel, dubbed Tilhengeren in Norwegian). The publication was discontinued in 1943 because of a paper shortage during the Second World War.
The publication was re-launched in 1963 with a "women's profile" focusing on family life, home, and fashion. By the following year, this editorial profile had been abandoned, and A-magasinet was oriented toward entertaining journalism. The first color photos appeared in it in 1966, and since then photojournalism has been an important part of the supplement. In 1984, Per Egil Hegge became the editor and refreshed the publication's style. A consistent feature was crime stories and writing competitions with humorous illustrations by Sven Sønsteby. During this period, the nature photographer Sverre M. Fjelstad contributed the feature "Naturen rundt oss" (The Natural World around Us) for 20 years. A-magasinet was discontinued in 1993, after many of the advertisers switched to Schibsted's newly launched TV 2.
The third incarnation of A-magasinet began when it was relaunched on October 21, 2005. Kjersti Løken Stavrum, the former editor-in-chief for the weekly magazine Kvinner og Klær, became the editor. In 2013, Lillian Vambheim succeeded Stavrum.

=== A-maze-ing Laughter ===
A-maze-ing Laughter is a 2009 bronze sculpture by Yue Minjun, located in Morton Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.


== Description ==
A-maze-ing Laughter was designed by Yue Minjun and installed in Morton Park (Davie and Denman) along the English Bay in West End, Vancouver in 2009. The patinated bronze sculpture, composed of 14 statues each about three meters tall and weighing over 250 kilograms, portrays the artist's own image "in a state of hysterical laughter". It was created as part of the Vancouver International Sculpture Biennale, which exhibits international contemporary works in public spaces. The sculpture was donated to the City of Vancouver by Chip and Shannon Wilson through the Wilson5 Foundation on August 11, 2012.
As part of the installation, an inscription carved into cement seating states "May this sculpture inspire laughter playfulness and joy in all who experience it."


== Reception ==
A-maze-ing Laughter was nominated in the Great Places in Canada Contest 2013 and was the only work of public art to receive a nomination.

=== A-normal form ===
In computer science, A-normal form (abbreviated ANF, sometimes expanded as administrative normal form or as atomic normal form) is an intermediate representation of programs in functional programming language compilers. 
In ANF, all arguments to a function must be trivial (constants or variables).  That is, evaluation of each argument must halt immediately. 
ANF was introduced by Sabry and Felleisen in 1992 as a simpler alternative to continuation-passing style (CPS).  Some of the advantages of using CPS as an intermediate representation are that optimizations are easier to perform on programs in CPS than in the source language, and that it is also easier for compilers to generate machine code for programs in CPS. Flanagan et al. showed how compilers could use ANF to achieve those same benefits with one source-level transformation; in contrast, for realistic compilers the CPS transformation typically involves additional phases, for example, to simplify CPS terms.


== Grammar ==
Consider the pure λ-calculus with constants and let-expressions. The ANF restriction is enforced by

allowing only values (variables, constants, and λ-terms), to serve as operands of function applications, and
requiring that the result of a non-trivial expression (such as a function application) be immediately captured in a let-bound variable.
The following BNF grammars show how one would modify the syntax of λ-expressions to implement the constraints of ANF:

Variants of ANF used in compilers or in research often allow records, tuples, multiargument functions, primitive operations and conditional expressions as well.


== Examples ==
The expression:

f(g(x),h(y))

is written in ANF as:

let v0 = g(x) in
    let v1 = h(y) in
        f(v0,v1)

By imagining the sort of assembly this function call would produce:

;; let v0 = g(x)
move x into args[0]
call g
move result into temp[0]
;; let v1 = h(y)
move y into args[0]
call h
move result into temp[1]
;; f(v0, v1)
move temp[0] into args[0]
move temp[1] into args[1]
call f

One can see the immediate similarities between ANF and the compiled form of a function; this property is a part of what makes ANF a good intermediate representation for optimisations in compilers.

=== A-not-A question ===
In linguistics, an A-not-A question or A-neg-A question, is a type of polar question used primarily in Sinitic languages that asks about something by presenting both its positive and negative possibilities. Instead of allowing a simple "yes" or "no" answer, these questions require the respondent to repeat either the positive or negative part of the original question. For example, in Mandarin, instead of asking "Do you want to go?" and expecting a "yes" or "no", the question might be structured as "Want-not-want to go?"
A-not-A questions are characterized by their inherent linguistic neutrality, with the interrogator deliberately avoiding any presumption about the truth of the statement being questioned. This neutrality is achieved through a value-neutral presentation that simultaneously offers both positive and negative forms of a proposition. While the term "A-not-A question" originated in Mandarin, it has since been expanded to describe similar interrogative structures in other Chinese dialects, such as the kam questions in Taiwanese Hokkien and ka questions in Singapore Teochew (ST). However, these dialect-specific variations are not simply identical copies but possess distinct linguistic properties that can sometimes differ significantly from the original Mandarin form.


== Forms ==
The wider category of A-not-A questions contains multiple distinct forms. These forms are differentiated on the basis of the location of the Negation constituent and the presence or absence of duplicate material.


=== A-not-A form ===
This is the most atomic form of the A-not-A question, which contains two identical instances of the constituent A separated by negation.


=== AB-not-AB form ===
This is a more complex form, containing two instances of the complex constituent AB separated by the negation. AB may represent an embedded clause, a subject joined with a prepositional phrase, or a verb phrase containing a DP.


=== A-not-AB form ===
This form contains two unique constituents, A and AB, separated by the negation. A and AB are similar in that AB contains the entire content of A, but constituents are present in AB that are not present in A.


=== AB-not-A form ===
This form is similar to the A-not-AB form, but the more complex constituent AB occurs before the negation.


=== a-not-A form ===
This form is only found in instances where A is disyllabic constituent with initial syllable a, and the two constituents are separated by negation.


=== a-not-AB form ===
This form is similar to the a-not-A form with a representing the initial syllable of A and the two separated by negation, but A is joined to another constituent to form the complex constituent AB.


== Similar forms in English ==
For the English question (1.a) "Are you happy or sad?", the response to this question must be an echo answer, stating either "I am happy," or the acceptable alternative, "I am sad". In other words, this sentence is a leading question, where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. In contrast, (1.b) "Are you happy or not?" is a neutral question where the answer to this can be yes or no in response to the first and more explicitly stated alternative.

         (1.a) Q: Are you happy or sad?
               A: I am happy.
                  I am sad.

         (1.b) Q: Are you happy or not (happy)?
               A: Yes.
                  No. 

A-not-A questions are not usually used in English, but the following example shows how A-not-A questions are answered.

         (2) Q: Did John eat beans or not?
             A: (Yes,) John ate beans.
                (No,) John didn't eat beans.
                *Yes.
                *No.

As seen in this example, simply answering "Yes" or "No" does not suffice as a response to the question. This question must be answered in the "A" or "not A" form. If this question was asked in the A-not-A pattern, its direct form would be "Did John eat or not eat the beans?".  However, the above examples also illustrate that A-not-A type questions in English usually contain some comparative operator such as "or" which is not seen in the Sinitic forms. There is also no significant evidence of either of the disyllabic A-not-A forms in English. These factors complicate the inclusion of English in the set of languages that contain the A-not-A question type, and though there are close English approximations in some cases, the A-not-A question is more accurately exemplified in Sinitic languages.


=== Approximations ===
Below are examples of English approximations of the A-not-A question. They are similar to the Sinitic A-not-A in that they present two possibilities and require an echoed response. However, they include an extra segment ("or" in the below examples) in order to read grammatically, which changes these approximations to an alternative question (AltQ) type. This extra segment is not seen in Sinitic A-not-A questions, and in fact the Mandarin segment 還是 haishi 'or' is used to contrast the syntax of the A-not-A form and demonstrate the latter's sensitivity to islands. Nevertheless, for the convenience of understanding this phenomenon from the perspective of an English speaker, the below examples are included to provide context.


==== A-not-A form ====
(1) Was John at the party or not at the party?


==== AB-not-A form ====
(2) Was John at the party last night or not at the party?


==== A-not-AB form ====
(4) Was John at the party or not at the party last night?


==== AB-not-AB form ====
(3) Was John at the party last night or not at the party last night?

=== NQ Morpheme ===
It is proposed that the A-not-A sequence is morpheme created by the reduplication of the interrogative morpheme (represented by the A in A-not-A). Though the specific syntactic location of this morpheme is not agreed upon, it is generally accepted that the A-not-A sequence is essentially a word formed by the concatenation of an abstract question morpheme and this duplicated predicate, which likens it to a VP-proclitic. This Morpheme is referred to as NQ in order to represent its character as negative and interrogative.


=== Similarity to kam-type questions ===
An extensive cross-dialectic survey conducted in 1985 concluded that the Taiwanese question particle kam appears in the same contexts as the hypothesized Mandarin NQ. From this, it was concluded that kam-type questions and A-not-A questions are in complementary distribution: a language either has kam-type questions or A-not-A questions but not both. It was also interpreted that kam and NQ are "different morphological exponents of the same underlying morpheme".


=== Movement, sensitivity, and parallels to weishenme 'why' ===
Unlike the yes/no question type formed using the segment "ma", the A-not-A question can be embedded, and may scope beyond its own clause. This scoping may be blocked if the original location of NQ and its intended final location are separated by an island boundary. These distributional characteristics of NQ are parallel to non-nominal adjunct question particle weishenme 'why'. Due to the uncontroversial nature of the movement-based analysis of weishenme, the similarity of the NQ to weishenme implies that NQ may be subject to the same analysis of its movement.


==== Sensitivity to islands ====

The dominant view on A-not-A questions is that NQ is similar to a wh-word and related by the movement of NQ. This movement is not seen in alternative-type questions using haishi 'or', and therefore delineates A-not-A questions from alternative questions in terms of structure. Due to this syntactic differentiation, A-not-A questions may be contrasted with haishi questions for the purpose of revealing island sensitivity.


== Sinitic examples ==
The following are examples of A-not-A questions in languages belonging to the Sinitic linguistic family.


=== In Mandarin ===
In forming A-not-A questions, A must remain the same on both sides.  A is essentially a variable which can be replaced with a grammatical particle such as a modal, adverb, adjective, verb, or preposition.


==== Patterns ====
In Mandarin, there are 6 attested patterns of A-not-A: A-not-A, AB-not-AB, A-not-AB, AB-not-A, a-not-A, and a-not-AB of which "A" stands for the full form of the predicate, "B" stands for the complement, and "a" stands for the first syllable of a disyllabic predicate.


===== A-not-A form =====
Example (3) illustrates that A-not-A pattern, where A is the verb qu 'go', and qu bu qu is 'go not go'.


===== AB-not-AB form =====
Example (4) illustrates the AB-not-AB pattern, where AB is the constituent consisting of the verb rende, 'know', as A, and the complement zhe ge ren, 'this CL man', as B, combining to form the AB constituent rende zhe ge ren 'know this CL man'.  This produces rende zhe ge bu rende zhe ge ren, 'know this CL man not know this CL man.'


===== A-not-AB form =====
Example (5) illustrates the A-not-AB pattern, where A is the verb rende, 'know', AB is the constituent consisting of the A verb rende, 'know', and the complement   zhe ge ren, 'this CL man', as B, combining to form the AB constituent rende zhe ge ren 'know this CL man'.  This produces rende bu rende zhe ge ren, 'know not know this CL man'.


===== AB-not-A form =====
Example (6) illustrates the AB-not-A pattern, where AB is the constituent rende zhe ge ren, 'know this CL man' consisting of rende, 'know' as A and zhe ge ren, 'this CL man as B; A is likewise rende, 'know', in the second part of the construction.  This produces rende zhe ge ren bu rende, 'know this CL man not know'.


===== a-not-A form =====
Example (7) illustrates the a-not-A pattern, where a is the first syllable, fang, of the disyllabic predicate fangbian, 'convenient', and A is the full predicate fangbian, and fang-bu-fangbian is 'con(venient)-not convenient'.


===== a-not-AB form =====
Example (8) illustrates the a-not-AB pattern, where a is the first syllable, he, of the disyllabic predicate heshi, 'suitable', and AB is the constituent consisting of heshi, 'suitable' as A and jiao quan, 'teaching fist' as B, combining to form the AB constituent heshi jia quan, 'suitable teaching fist'.  This produces he-bu heshi jian quan, 'suit(able)-not suitable teaching fist'.


==== Grammatical particles used to form A-not-A questions ====
A-not-A can be formed by a verb, an adjective, or an adverb, as well as modals.


===== Verb =====
In the interrogative clause, A-not-A occurs by repeating the first part in the verbal group (with the option of an auxiliary) and the negative form of the particle is placed in between. However, this clause does not apply when using perfective in aspect. Instead, 沒有; meiyou is used to replace the repeated verb used in A-not-A form.

V-NEG-V type:
Here, the verb qu, 'go', is A, and there is no object.

V-NEG-V-Object type:
Here the verb kan, 'watch', is again A, and while there is an object, the object is not included in "A", and is therefore not reduplicated.

V-Object-NEG type:
Here, the verb kan, 'watch', is likewise A, and while the object is included before NEG, it is not included in A, and is therefore not reduplicated, although it remains an option.

V-Object-NEG-V type(debatable):
Here, the verb kan, 'watch', is also used for A, and while the object is included before NEG, it is not included in A, and is therefore not reduplicated. A is reduplicated here.

Answers to (9.a), (9.b), (9.c), and (9.d) must be in the form "V" or "not-V"
There is some debate among speakers as to whether or not 3.d. is grammatical, and Gasde argues that it is.


===== Adjective or adverb =====
A-NEG-A type:
Here, the adjective hao, 'good', is A, and it is reduplicated. The word ben is a classifier, which means it is a counter word for the noun 'book'.

A-NEG type:
Here, the adjective hao, 'good', is A, but it is not reduplicated.

Answers to (10.a), (10.b) must be in the form A or not-A.


===== Preposition =====
P-NEG-P type:
Here, the preposition zai, 'at',  is A, and it is reduplicated.

P-NEG-P type:
Here, the preposition zai, 'at', is A, and it is not reduplicated.

Answers to (11.a) and (11.b) must be in the form P or not-P.


===== Modal =====
M-NEG-M-V-Object type:
Here, the modal dare is A and it is reduplicated.

The answer to (12.a) must be in the form M or not-M.


=== A-not-A questions in Cantonese ===
Despite having the same negative marker as Mandarin, "不" bat1 is only used in fixed expressions or to give literacy quality, and only "唔" m4  is used as a negative marker in A-not-A questions.
One distinction in Cantonese when compared to Mandarin is that certain forms of A-not-A questions are not attested due to dialectal differences.


==== Patterns ====


===== A-not-A form =====
Like its Mandarin counterpart, this form is attested in Cantonese as shown by the sentence pair in (13), where in example (13.a), A is the verb lai, 'come', and lai m lai is 'come not come', and in (13.b), A is the verb lai, 'come', and lai bu lai is 'come not come'.


===== AB-not-AB form =====
As shown by (14.a), this is not an attested form in Cantonese, unlike the counterpart in Mandarin in (14.b).
Here in (14.a) A is the verb zungji, 'like', and B the noun jamok, 'music', producing the AB form zungji jamok, 'like music'.  This would produce the ungrammatical structure zungji jamok m zungji jamok, 'like music not like', which is a poorly-formed sentence in Cantonese.
In the well-formed sentence shown below in (14.b), A is the verb xihuan, 'like', and B is the noun yinyue, 'music', producing the AB form xihuan yinyue, 'like music'.  This produces xihuan yinyue bu xihuan yinue, 'like music not like music', a grammatical sentence in Mandarin.


===== A-not-AB form =====
This form is only attested in Cantonese if the predicate is a monosyllabic word as shown by (15.a), where A is the verb faan, 'return', and AB is the constituent faan ukkei, 'return home'.  This can be compared to the Mandarin counterpart in (15.b) where A is the verb hui, 'return', and AB is the constituent hui jia, 'return home.

A-not-AB is not attested in Cantonese if the predicate is a bi-syllabic word as shown by (16.a), where A would be the verb zungji, 'like', and AB would be the constituent zungji jamok, 'like music'.  This contrasts with its Mandarin counterpart in (16.b), where A is the verb xihuan, 'like', and B is the complement yinyuee, music', combining into the AB form xihuan yinyue, 'like music'. In such cases, Cantonese speakers usually use the form a-not-AB, like (8).


===== AB-not-A form =====
This form is only attested in Cantonese if the predicate is a monosyllabic word A, exemplified in (17.a) with the verb faan, 'return', with an object B, exemplified in (17.a) with the noun ukkei, 'home'.  (17.a) is shown below with its Mandarin counterpart in (17.b), where A is the verb hui, 'return', and B is the noun jia, 'home'.

Such forms of AB-not-A in monosyllabic words are used by older generations.
When the predicate is a bi-syllabic word, then AB-not-A form is not attested as shown in (18.a), unlike its Mandarin counterpart in (18.b).


=== In Amoy ===
Amoy exhibits A-not-A forms, and differs from Mandarin and Cantonese in its frequent use of modals or auxiliaries in forming these constructions.  Amoy forms also differ in that the morphemes for A do not match each other in a given sentence.  In these constructions one of the morphemes may also be deleted, as can be seen in Examples (27), (28), and (29), though when this happens it may only be deleted from the negative predicate.


==== Negative markers in Amoy ====
The following negative markers are used. Alternate transliterations are shown in bold.    

         (19)   a.  m        negative of volition (m-1)                                
                b.  m        negative simplex (m-2)
                c.  bo       negative possessive/existential/affirmative aspect 
                    bou         
                d.  bue      negative potential/possibility
                e.  be       negative perfective aspect

While m-1 occurs as a free morpheme with its own semantic feature indicating volition, m-2 cannot function by itself as a verb and works only to express negation.  It is attested only with a limited amount of verbs.


==== A-not-A constructions ====
Shown below are A-not-A constructions in Amoy.


===== With auxiliaries that can be used as main verbs =====
The following is a list of A-not-A constructions in Amoy with auxiliary verbs which may function as the main verb of a sentence.


====== U — bou: 'have — not have' ======
The auxiliary verb u here functions as an aspectual marker indicating that an action has been completed.  In u — bou A-not-A constructions, u functions as the first A, corresponding with the auxiliary 'have', while bou functions as the second A of the A-not-A construction, corresponding with the negative counterpart 'not have'.  Example (20) illustrates the use of this construction.


====== Bat — m bat: 'to have experienced — not to have experienced' ======
The auxiliary verb bat functions as an aspectual marker indicating experience.  In bat — m bat A-not-A constructions, bat functions as the first A, corresponding with an auxiliary expressing the sense of 'to have experienced', while m bat functions as the second A of the A-not-A constructions, corresponding with the negative counterpart 'not to have experienced'.  Example (21) illustrates the use of this construction.


====== Si — m si: 'to be — not to be' ======
The auxiliary verb si works to express emphasis.  In si — m si  constructions A-not-A constructions, si functions as the first A, roughly corresponding with 'to be', and m si as the second A, indicating the negative counterpart 'not to be'.  Example (22) illustrates the use of this construction.


===== With auxiliaries that cannot be used as main verbs =====
The following is a list of A-not-A constructions in Amoy with auxiliary verbs which may never be used as the main verb of a sentence.


====== Beq — m: 'to want to — not to want to' ======
The use of a beq — m construction is used to express an intention or an expectation.  In these constructions, beq functions as the first A, indicating 'to want to', and m as the second A, here working with beq to express its negative counterpart 'not want to.' Example (23) illustrates the use of this construction.


====== Tiouq — m bian: 'must — must not' ======
The use of a tiouq — m bian construction expresses a sense of obligation.  In these constructions, tiouq functions as the first A, indicating 'must', and m bian as the second A, here indicating the negative counterpart 'must not'.  Example (24) illustrates the use of this construction.


====== T'ang — m t'ang: 'may — may not' ======
The use of a t'ang — m t'ang construction expresses a sense of permission. In these constructions, t'ang functions as the first A, indicating 'may', and m t'ang as the second A, here indicating the negative counterpart 'may not'.  Example (25) illustrates the use of this construction.


====== E — bue: 'could — could not' ======
The use of an e — bue construction expresses a sense of possibility or probability.  In these constructions, e functions as the first A, indicating 'could', and bue as the second A, here indicating the negative counterpart 'could not'.  Example (26) illustrates the use of this construction.


====== E tang — bue tang: 'can, ability to do something — can't, inability to do something' ======
The use of an e tang — bue tang construction expresses a sense of the ability to do something.  In these constructions, e tang functions as the first A, indicating 'can', and bue tang as the second A, here indicating the negative counterpart 'can't'.  Example (27) illustrates the use of this construction as well as an instance of deletion from the negative predicate.


====== E sai — bue sai: 'could, can manage to or might — couldn't, couldn't manage or might not' ======
The use of an e sai — bue sai  construction expresses a sense of a potential ability to do something.  In these constructions, e sai functions as the first A, indicating 'could', and bue sai as the second A, here indicating the counterpart 'couldn't'.  Example (28) illustrates the use of this construction as well as an instance of deletion from the negative predicate.


====== E hiau — bue hiau: 'to know how/be knowledgeable about — not to know how/be knowledgeable about' ======
The use of an e hiau — bue hiau construction expresses a sense of one's knowledge.  In these constructions, e hiau functions as the first A, indicating 'to know how', and bue hiau as the second A, here indicating the negative counterpart 'not to know how'.  Example (29) illustrates the use of this construction as well as an instance of deletion from the negative predicate.


== In Korean ==

The following are examples of A-not-A questions in Korean.
There are three salient morphological varieties of A-not-A question in Korean. Like all A-not-A questions, the questions can be answered with an affirmative, 네, ney, or negative 아니요, anyo.


=== Pre-predicate negation ===
Both an and mos can precede the predicate in A-not-A questions.


==== An ====
Example (26) illustrates the use of an, short form for ani-, which expresses simple negation.  Here A is ca-ni, 'sleep-COMP', and ca-ni an ca-ni is 'sleep-COMP not sleep-COMP'.


==== Mos ====
Example (27) illustrates the use of mos, which expresses impossibility or inability.  Here A is ka-ss-ni, 'go-PAST-COMP' and ka-ss-ni mos ka-ss-ni is 'go-PAST-COMP cannot go-PAST-COMP'.


=== Inherently-negative predicate ===
Korean has three negative predicates that can form A-not-A question, molu-, eps-, and ani-.


==== Molu- ====
Example (28) illustrates the use of molu-, which means 'don't know'.


==== Eps- ====
Example (29) illustrates the use of esp-, which means 'do not have; do not exist'.


==== Ani- ====
Example (30) illustrates the use of ani-, which means 'is not'.


=== Negative modal auxiliary ===


==== Mal ====
Meaning 'desist from', mal follows an affirmative polar question, and will occur instead of a reduplicated full verb that has a post predicate negation, meaning that there is only one full verb in this type of A-not-A question.

However, the modal auxiliary verb mal is restricted in that it does not co-occur in predicative adjectives or the factual complementizer ni. Moreover, with mal being a bound form, it cannot be the echo negative answer. Instead, the full negative verb will be provided as the answer, taking an negation, as illustrated in (32).


== Analysis: The post-syntactic approach ==
One analysis of the formation of the A-not-A construction is the post-syntactic approach, through two stages of M-merger. First, the A-not-A operator targets the morphosyntactic word (MWd) which is the head that is closest to it and undergoes lowering. Then, reduplication occurs to yield the surface form of the A-not-A question.

Tseng suggests that A-not-A occurs post-syntactically, at the morphological level. It is movement that occurs overtly at the phonetic form, after the syntactic movement has occurred. A-not-A is a feature of T that operates on the closest, c-commanded MWd, and not subwords (SWd). The elements that undergo post-syntactic movement are MWds. A node X  is a MWd iff X is the highest segment and X is not contained in another X. A node X is a SWd if X  is a terminal node and not an MWd. The A-not-A operation is a MWd to MWd movement.


=== Conditional criteria for grammatical A-not-A question derivation ===


==== A-not-A operator lowering ====
The A-not-A operator is defined as an MWd. The A-not-A operator can only lower to a MWd which is immediately dominated by the maximal projection that is also immediately dominated by the maximal projection of the A-not-A operator. An SWd cannot be the target for the A-not-A operator. In addition, if there is an intervening MWd or SWd between the A-not-A operator and its target, the A-not-A operation fails.
A-not-A operator lowering must satisfy four conditions:

The A-not-A operator targets the closest MWd that is the X′-theoretic head that it c-commands.
Closeness of the head is qualified by: (i) The closest head is a X′-theoretic head of the maximal which is immediately dominated by the maximal projection of the A-not-A operator. (ii) The target must have overt phonological realization.
There is not any non-X′-theoretic head or SWd intervening between the A-not-A operator and its target.
Intervention is defined by c-command relation.

After lowering, the A-not-A operator triggers reduplication on the target node. The reduplication domain can be the first syllable of the targeted element, the targeted element itself, and the maximal projection that contains the targeted element. Reduplication is linear and the A-not-A operator cannot skip the adjacent constituent to copy the next constituent.


==== Reduplication of first syllable of adjacent morphosyntactic word ====
In first syllable reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the first syllable of the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant, i.e. copied syllable, to the left of the base MWd. Then the negation is inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (33.a), the A-not-A operator copies the first syllable tao of the MWd taoyan. The reduplicant tao is put at the left of the base taoyan and then the negative constituent bu is inserted in between. In figure (33.b) *Zhangsan taoyan Lisi-bu-tao is ungrammatical because tao cannot be put to the right of the maximal projection VP, taoyan Lisi.


==== Reduplication of adjacent morphosyntactic word ====
In MWd reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant MWd overtly to the left of the base MWd or to right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd. Otherwise, the reduplicant can move covertly, i.e. in such a way that there is no overt surface evidence, to the right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd. The negation is then inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (34.a) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd taoyan. The reduplicant taoyan is overtly put at the left of the base taoyan and then the negative constituent bu is inserted in between. In (34.b) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd taoyan. The reduplicant taoyan is overtly put at the right of the base taoyan Lisi and then the negative constituent bu is inserted in between. In (34.c) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd taoyan. The reduplicant taoyan is covertly put at the right of the base taoyan Lisi after which the negative constituent bu is inserted.


==== Reduplication of the maximal projection containing adjacent morphosyntactic word ====
In maximal projection reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the maximal projection that contains the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant either to the left or to the right of the base. The base may be just the MWd or the maximal projection containing the MWd. The maximal projection may be any XP (VP, AP, PP etc.). The negation is then inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (35) the A-not-A operator copies the maximal projection VP taoyan Lisi. The reduplicant taoyan Lisi is put at the left of the base taoyan Lisi and then the negative constituent bu is inserted in between.

=== A-not-B error ===
The A-not-B error is an incomplete or absent schema of object permanence, normally observed during the sensorimotor stage of Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development.
A typical A-not-B task goes like this: An experimenter hides an attractive toy under box "A" within the baby's reach. The baby searches for the toy, looks under box "A", and finds the toy. This activity is usually repeated several times (always with the researcher hiding the toy under box "A"), which means the baby has the ability to pass the object permanence test. Then, in the critical trial, the experimenter moves the toy under box "B", also within easy reach of the baby. Babies of 10 months or younger typically make the perseveration error, meaning they look under box "A" even though they saw the researcher move the toy under box "B", and box "B" is just as easy to reach. Piaget called this phenomenon A-not-B error. This demonstrates a lack of, or incomplete, schema of object permanence, shows that the infant's cognition of the existence of the object at this time still depends on the actions he makes to the object. Children of 12 months or older (in the preoperational stage of Piaget's theory of cognitive development) typically do not make this error.


== Competing explanations ==
Traditionally, this phenomenon has been explained as the child seeing an image and remembering where it was, rather than where it is. Other accounts deal with the development of planning, reaching, and deciding things. There are also behaviorist accounts that explain the behavior in terms of reinforcement. This account argues that the repeated trials with hiding the toy in box "A" is reinforcing that specific behavior, so that the child still reaches for box "A" because the action has been reinforced before. However, this account does not explain the shift in behavior that occurs around 12 months.
Smith and Thelen used a dynamic systems approach to the A-not-B task. They found that various components of the activity (strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time, stance) combine in the "B"-trial (where the object is hidden in the "B" location rather than "A") so the child either correctly or incorrectly searches for the toy. They experimentally manipulated the task to see if they could make 10-month-old babies (who typically make the perseverative error of searching at "A") perform like 12-month-old babies (who typically search correctly). Changing the stance of the baby (sitting or standing) was one manipulation they found could make the 10-month-old search correctly. Just standing instead of sitting for the "B"-trial made the prior experience of searching in location "A" less salient to the child, who then searched correctly. The researchers concluded that the length of wait time was one of the crucial elements of the task that is influenced by age.

=== A-okay ===
A-okay or A-OK () is a more intensive word form of the English term OK. The phrase can be accompanied by, or substituted with, the OK sign.


== History ==
The phrase "A-ok" had been in use at least as far back as 1952, when it appeared in an advertisement by Midvac Steels which read "A-OK for tomorrow's missile demands".
U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. John "Shorty" Powers popularized it while serving in the 1960s as NASA's public affairs officer for Project Mercury, the "voice of Mercury Control". He was reported as attributing the expression to astronaut Alan Shepard during his historic Freedom 7 flight, which was the United States' first crewed space flight. In his book The Right Stuff, author Tom Wolfe wrote that Powers had borrowed the expression from NASA engineers who used it during radio transmission tests because "the sharper sound of A cut through the static better than O".
The NASA publication, This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury, says in a footnote that "A replay of the flight voice communications tape disclosed that Shepard himself did not use the term" and that "Tecwyn Roberts of STG and Capt. Henry E. Clements of the Air Force had used 'A.OK' frequently in reports written more than four months before the Shepard flight."

=== A-paper ===
In the mortgage industry of the United States, A-paper is a term to describe a mortgage loan (or a Prime loan) for which the asset and borrower meet the following criteria:

In the United States, the borrower has a credit score of 680 or higher
The borrower fully documents their income and assets
The borrower's debt to income ratio does not exceed 35%
The borrower retains 2 months of mortgage payments in reserves after closing
The borrower injects at least 20% equity
Furthermore, there are some criteria that are guiding factors, such as the borrower having stability in the line of work and/or living in the same property for two or more years.

=== A-paracompact space ===
In mathematics, in the field of topology, a topological space is said to be a-paracompact if every open cover of the space has a locally finite refinement. In contrast to the definition of paracompactness, the refinement is not required to be open.
Every paracompact space is a-paracompact, and in regular spaces the two notions coincide.

=== A-ra-shi: Reborn ===
"A-ra-shi: Reborn" is a song by Japanese boy band Arashi, released as a single via J Storm on December 20, 2019, as announced on their official social media accounts. The song was later included in the Arashi Reborn Vol.1 extended play, released on February 28, 2020, together with "A Day in Our Life: Reborn", and "One Love: Reborn".


== Background ==
The song was announced in a video shared on the band's official social media, and serves as a thank you to the fans for helping them celebrate their 20th anniversary.  The song marks the first part of a new "Reborn" project.  "A-ra-shi: Reborn" was uploaded as an audio video to the group's YouTube channel, and was included in download and streaming sites. On its first day, the song managed to reach over one million views in YouTube.  It was announced on February 24, 2020, in Arashi's official site at Johnny's, that this song, along with two others, would be included in the "Arashi Reborn Vol. 1" EP released on February 28, 2020 for digital download and streaming.
"A-ra-shi: Reborn" is a new version of the group's debut song "Arashi" with a new arrangement and sound, as well as including more English in its lyrics, which also reflect changes in the group itself, as it opened to an international audience. The original had a funky sound to it, while "Reborn" uses Auto-Tune in its vocals. The rap part has been also changed, with Sho Sakurai writing a new lyric. And the singing has moved from a very group-centered mode to a multi-solo one.
In "Reborn", the lyrics reflect Arashi's ("Hey we are The Storm") rise as a group, reaching close at their goal, while being held there by their fans ("You’re filling me with energy You are the wind..."), as well as making Arashi an individual dream ("A-ra-shi, A-ra-shi, my dream") come true for each of the five members ("five clouds"), whereas in "A-ra-shi", the lyrics reflected the dreams ("A-ra-shi, A-ra-shi, for dream") of the group of teens as a whole ("one cloud") that just started their rise to fame ("Gather the wind in your body and make a storm happen").


== Music video ==
On December 23, a teaser video was uploaded to Arashi's YouTube channel, made in collaboration with the anime One Piece. The 39-second video has the five animated members of the band mingling with the crew from the anime, up until the moment when Arashi is about to give a concert. The full version video was released on January 4, 2020.

=== A-ration ===
The A-ration (officially Field Ration, Type A) is a United States military ration consisting of fresh, refrigerated, or frozen foods. A-rations may be served in dining facilities, prepared in the field using field kitchens, or prepared at a fixed facility and transported to field locations in containers. Its modern successor is the Unitized Group Ration – A (UGR-A), which combines multiple types of rations, including the A-ration, under one unified system.
The A-ration differs from other U.S. alphabetized rations such as the B-ration, consisting of canned or preserved food; C-ration, consisting of prepared wet food when A- and B-rations are not available; D-ration, consisting of military chocolate; K-ration, consisting of three balanced meals; and emergency rations, intended for emergencies when other food or rations are unavailable.


== Unitized Group Ration A ==
A-rations today may include the Unitized Group Ration – A, a hybrid meal kit designed to feed a group of 50 people for one meal. The UGR-A has several different varieties, including a tray-based heat and serve (T-rat) form, heated by hot water immersion when a field kitchen is not available, or the express form, with a self-heating module and disposable accessories. The UGR-A is used to sustain military personnel during worldwide operations that allow organized food service facilities.  
The UGR-A includes perishable/frozen type entrees (A-rations) along with commercial-type components and perishable/frozen type entrees to provide the luxury of an A-ration meal in the field, configured into individual meal modules for ease of ordering, distribution, and preparation. The UGR-A has at least 9 months shelf life (at 80 °F or 27 °C for semi-perishable modules and at 0 °F or −18 °C for perishable modules).

=== A-round the Corner (Beneath the Berry Tree) ===
"A-round the Corner (Beneath the Berry Tree)", also titled "Ay-round the Corner (Bee-hind The Bush)" or "A-round the Corner (Be-neath The Berry Tree)", is a traditional popular song adapted by Josef Marais, from the repertoire of Marais and Miranda. The title was first published in February 1952, but an earlier version was registered in August 1940. The most popular version was recorded by Jo Stafford on 10 December 1951 with accompaniment by her partner Paul Weston and the Norman Luboff Choir. It was issued on Columbia 39653 and entered the Billboard chart in March 1952, peaking at number nine, also making number 12 on the Cash Box chart. A recording by The Weavers and Gordon Jenkins on Decca charted in April and reached number 19.
In the UK, the song entered the chart based on sheet music sales in April, and reached number one in May, holding the top spot for three weeks. Both the recordings by Stafford and The Weavers were available in the UK, alongside versions by British artists The Stargazers, Edmundo Ros and The Tanner Sisters.

=== A-segment ===
The A-segment is the first category in the passenger car classification system defined by the European Commission. It is used for city cars, the smallest category of passenger cars defined.
A-segment sales represented approximately 4.2% of the European market in 2024. It is approximately equivalent to the kei car class in Japan.


== Definition ==
As of 2021, the A-segment category size spans from approximately 2.7 metres (110 in) to 3.7 metres (150 in).


== Characteristics ==
Body styles for A-segment cars in Europe are always hatchbacks. But as crossovers gain popularity, new models may shift to resemble crossovers. Examples of crossover city cars include Suzuki Ignis and Toyota Aygo X. Other body styles such as sedans are not present in this segment because these shapes largely prove impractical at typical A-segment dimensions.


== Current models ==

In 2020 the ten highest selling A-segment cars in Europe were Fiat Panda, Fiat 500, Toyota Aygo, Renault Twingo, Volkswagen Up!, Hyundai i10, Kia Picanto, Peugeot 108, Citroën C1 and Suzuki Ignis.

== Market share in Europe ==

2019 - In 2019, sales of minicars were down 2% compared to a total market gain of 1% which means this segment now makes up 7.7% of the total European car market at 1.21 million sales, down from 8% in 2018. And with margins on minicars under pressure due to increased costs to comply with stricter safety and emissions standards, manufacturers are scaling back investments in to minicars or switching to an EV-only strategy. 

In Italy, A-segment cars represented 16.4% of car sales in the first half of 2019.
2020 - European sales of minicars were down by a third in 2020, which translates to nearly 400,000 fewer sales and means the segment loses market share as the overall market is down 24%. As a result, this segment now makes up 6.8% of the total European car market, down from 7.7% last year. And their share is expected to shrink further in coming years, as manufacturers are pulling out of this segment or switching their models to EV-only. This is a result of increasing costs to comply with stricter safety and especially emissions standards, which makes minicars nearly unprofitable, especially considering that for most models from European brands this is the only market.


== Market share in other countries ==
In the United States, minicar segment cars represented 0.5% of the market share.
In 2020 the highest selling minicar segment cars in  the U.S. were the Chevrolet Spark, Mitsubishi Mirage and Mini Cooper.
In India, historically the A-segment cars had the highest sales. Sales have been in decline in recent years, falling from 70,000 sales per month in 2014 to 47,000 sales per month in 2016.
As of 2019, several A-segment cars had successes outside Europe, such as Hyundai Grand i10, Honda Brio, Kia Picanto, Tata Tiago, Toyota Wigo, Suzuki Celerio, Suzuki Wagon R, Suzuki/Maruti Alto, Ford Figo, Smart ForTwo, Citroën C1, Peugeot 108, and modern Fiat 500.

=== A-series light bulb ===
The A-series light bulb is the "classic" glass light bulb shape that has been the most commonly used type for general lighting service (GLS) applications since the early 20th century. It has a pear-like shape and is typically fitted to either an Edison screw or a bayonet cap base. The number that follows the "A" designation indicates the nominal major diameter of the bulb, either in one-eighth inch units in North America or in millimeters in the rest of the world.

Although A-shape bulbs historically used incandescent lighting technology, A-shaped compact fluorescent (CFL) and LED lamps are also commonly available.


== Physical outline ==
The most commonly used A-series light bulb type is an A60 bulb (or its inch-based equivalent, the A19 bulb), which is 60 mm (19⁄8 in or 2+3⁄8 in) wide at its widest point and approximately 110 mm (4+3⁄8 in) in length.
Other sizes with a data sheet in IEC 60064 are A50, A55, A67, A68, A71, A75, and A80.
Another common A-series light bulb type is the A15 bulb which is commonly used in the US for appliances and ceiling fans. The A15 bulb is 15⁄8 in (1+7⁄8 in; 48 mm) wide at its widest point and 3.39 inches tall.


=== Socket type ===
In countries with a mains supply voltage of 100–120 volts (e.g., Canada, Taiwan, US), A19/A60 light bulbs usually come with an E26 type Edison screw base (i.e. 26 millimeters in diameter).  In the UK, Ireland and many Commonwealth countries, they usually come with a B22 type bayonet cap base.  In continental Europe and most other countries with a 220–240 volt supply, they usually come with an E27 type base.


=== Specifications ===
IEC/TR 60887:2010 defines the A bulb shape as: A bulb shape having a spherical end section that is joined to the neck by a radius that (a) has a centre outside the bulb, (b) has a magnitude greater than the radius of the spherical section, (c) and is tangent to both the neck and the curve of the spherical end section. 
The same standard also defines in addition to the A shape also bulged (B), conical (C), elliptical (E), flame (F), Globular (G), (K), mushroom (M), (P), reflector (R), straight-sided (S) and tubular (T) bulb shapes, as well as several modifier letters and special shapes. Very similar to the A shape are the P shape ("A bulb having a spherical end section, and a conical mid section, the sides of which are tangent to the curve of the spherical section"), and its PS variant ("Tubular neck section below the bulb and above the approximate reference line").

ANSI C79.1-2002, IS 14897:2000, and JIS C 7710:1988  define the "A shape" as "a bulb shape having a spherical end section that is joined to the neck by a radius", where the radius is greater than that of the sphere, corresponds to an osculating circle outside the light bulb, and is tangent to both the neck and the sphere.
The USA Energy Star certification requires omnidirectional light bulbs to fit the overall dimensions of the corresponding ANSI bulb type and a minimum Luminosity/Watt performance level.: 14.1

=== A-sharp ===
A-sharp or A♯ refers to:

A♯ (musical note),
A-sharp major, enharmonic key to B-flat major
A-sharp minor
A Sharp (.NET), a port of the Ada programming language to the .NET environment
A Sharp (Axiom), a programming language for the Axiom computer algebra system

=== A-sharp minor ===
A-sharp minor is a minor musical scale based on A♯, consisting of the pitches A♯, B♯, C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, and G♯. Its key signature has seven sharps.
Its relative major is C-sharp major (or enharmonically D-flat major). Its parallel major, A-sharp major, is usually replaced by B-flat major, since A-sharp major's three double-sharps make it impractical to use. The enharmonic equivalent of A-sharp minor is B-flat minor, which only contains five flats and is often preferable to use.
The A-sharp natural minor scale is:

Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary. The A-sharp harmonic minor and melodic minor scales are:

In Christian Heinrich Rinck's 30 Preludes and Exercises in all major and minor keys, Op. 67, the 16th Prelude and Exercise and Max Reger's On the Theory of Modulation on pp. 46~50 are in A-sharp minor. In Bach's Prelude and Fugue in C-sharp major, BWV 848, a brief section near the beginning of the piece modulates to A-sharp minor.


== Scale degree chords ==
The scale degree chords of A-sharp minor are:

Tonic – A-sharp minor
Supertonic – B-sharp diminished
Mediant – C-sharp major
Subdominant – D-sharp minor
Dominant – E-sharp minor
Submediant – F-sharp major
Subtonic – G-sharp major

Overview of compositions with 7 accidentals

=== A-side and B-side ===
The A-side and B-side are the two sides of vinyl records and cassettes, and the terms have often been printed on the labels of two-sided music recordings. The A-side of a single usually features a recording that its artist, producer, or record company intends to be the initial focus of promotional efforts and radio airplay, with the aim of it becoming a hit record. The B-side (or "flip-side") is a secondary recording that typically receives less attention, although some B-sides have been as successful as, or more so than, their A-sides.
Use of this language has largely declined in the 21st century as the music industry has transitioned away from analog recordings towards digital formats without physical sides, such as downloads and streaming. Nevertheless, some artists and labels continue to employ the terms A-side and B-side metaphorically to describe the type of content a particular release features, with B-side sometimes representing a "bonus" track or other material.


== History ==
Conventions shifted in the early 1960s, at which point record companies started assigning the song they wanted radio stations to play to side A, as 45 rpm single records ("45s") dominated most markets in terms of cash sales in comparison to albums, which did not fare as well financially. Throughout the decade the industry would slowly shift to an album-driven paradigm for releasing new music; it was not until 1968 that the total production of albums on a unit basis finally surpassed that of singles in the United Kingdom.
Today, with the vast majority of music released and accessed digitally on streaming services, the traditional A-side/B-side is obsolete as a technological necessity. Nonetheless, some contemporary artists have added on a second track to a single release as a nominal B-side, which can serve as an aesthetic choice as well as a promotional tool.


== Double A-side ==
A double A-side, AA-side, or dual single is a single where both sides are designated the A-side, with no designated B-side; that is, both sides are prospective hit songs and neither side will be promoted over the other. In 1949, Savoy Records promoted a new pair of singles by one of its artists, Paul Williams' "House Rocker" and "He Knows How to Hucklebuck", as "The New Double Side Hit – Both Sides 'A' Sides". In 1965, Billboard reported that due to a disagreement between EMI and John Lennon about which side of the Beatles' "We Can Work It Out" and "Day Tripper" single should be considered the A-side and receive the plugging, "EMI settled for a double-side promotion campaign—unique in Britain."
In the UK, before the advent of digital downloads, both A-sides were accredited with the same chart position, for the singles chart was compiled entirely from physical sales. In the UK, the biggest-selling non-charity single of all time was a double A-side, Wings' 1977 release "Mull of Kintyre"/"Girls' School", which sold over two million copies. It was also the UK Christmas No. 1 that year. Nirvana released "All Apologies" and "Rape Me" as a double A-side in 1993, and both songs are accredited as a hit on both the UK Singles Chart and the Irish Singles Chart.


== B/W ==

The term "b/w", an abbreviation of "backed with", is often used in listings to indicate the B-side of a record. The term "c/w", for "coupled with", is used similarly.


== Characteristics ==
B-sides are often considered to be filler material: songs of lower quality. However, some pop artists such as Prince, New Order, Pet Shop Boys, Def Leppard, the Cure, Tori Amos, Bon Jovi, Oasis, and the Beatles have been particularly known for releasing strong material on B-sides. B-sides have often been compiled on expanded or "deluxe" editions of albums or may be compiled into a "B-side compilation album" across multiple periods of an artist's career.

=== A-tom-ic Jones ===
A-tom-ic Jones is the second Tom Jones album for Decca, and third overall, released in 1966. The title is a pun. Les Reed was credited as the musical director.
Due to concerns over alarming the record-buying public, it was released in the US with a different cover, removing the nuclear explosion in the background. The US version also discarded four tracks, in favor of his two hit theme songs "Thunderball" and "Promise Her Anything."


== Reception ==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes: "Given the quality of the record, its lack of success isn't surprising. Jones sings well, but he doesn't have the material to match his performance, making the album noticeably weaker than his first two collections."

=== A-tractor ===
An A-tractor is a self-constructed agricultural tractor in Sweden from a converted production vehicle or vehicle parts, which can be driven with an AM driver's license. The top speed is mechanically and/or electronically limited to 30 km/h (19 mph). A-tractors are very popular among young people in Sweden.
Colloquially, A-tractors are often referred to as EPA tractors, which were the direct predecessors of these tractors.


== History ==
The construction of so-called EPA tractors began in Sweden in the late 1920s. These were self-constructed vehicles made from scrap vehicle parts or converted production vehicles (mostly cars). In the 1930s, they were more common in Sweden. In 1963, A-tractors were introduced as an alternative to EPA tractors. However, they were subject to stricter requirements and were therefore not widely used by young people. By 31 March 1975, EPA tractors were to be banned and completely replaced by A-tractors by March 1978 because the Swedish government considered EPA tractors a traffic and accident risk. After protests and the collection of approximately 6,800 signatures, the government changed its mind in 1978, and the regulations for EPA tractors and A-tractors were merged, allowing their continued use (including by young people) to this day.
By 2020, approximately 12,000 A-tractors (EPA tractors) were said to be in operation in Sweden. On 15 July 2020, the Swedish Ministry of Infrastructure eased the technical requirements for conversion to A-tractors, so that by the end of 2021, approximately 36,000 were said to be in operation.


== Differences in Tractors in Sweden ==
Since 1975, no new EPA tractors can be registered. A-type tractors are often referred to as EPA tractors, even if they refer to A-type tractors newly registered after 1975.
In addition to A-type tractors and B-type tractors, there is also a classification into tractor A and tractor B. Simply put, an A-type tractor is a car converted into a tractor, while a tractor A is a slow-moving tractor (the maximum speed of tractor A is 40 km/h (25 mph)). Tractors with a higher design speed are classified as tractor B. The distinction between tractor A and tractor B was only introduced in 2016.


== Design restrictions and specifications ==

The maximum design speed of an A-class tractor on a horizontal road surface may not exceed 30 km/h (±10%). An A-class tractor must be equipped with a towing hitch, passengers may only be transported on one row of seats (the driver and a maximum of two passengers), and the vehicle must be equipped with a so-called LGF sign (Swedish: Långsamtgående fordon) at the rear. This sign identifies the A-class tractor as a slow-moving vehicle.
As with the EPA tractor, the A-class tractor must be structurally designed to withstand the loads. A roll bar may be installed in certain circumstances. Unlike the EPA tractor, the A-class tractor is not required to have a rigid base frame; the body can also be self-supporting. Before first putting an A-class tractor into operation, it must undergo a registration inspection. After that, regular inspections are required: the first 48 months after initial registration and then every 24 months.
Workshops in Sweden offer vehicle conversions into A-class tractors.

=== A-train (Texas) ===
The A-train is a hybrid rail (light rail with some features similar to commuter rail) service in Denton County, Texas, United States. The service is operated by Rio Grande Pacific under the authority of the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA).
The 21-mile (34 km) line runs parallel to Interstate 35E between Denton and Carrollton. It acts as an extension of DART light rail's Green Line, which connects Carrollton to Dallas Love Field, Downtown Dallas, and Fair Park. The line opened on June 20, 2011.
In 2024, the line had a ridership of 273,000, or about 900 per weekday as of the first quarter of 2025. It is the fourth-busiest commuter rail line in Texas and the twenty-ninth busiest in the United States.


== History ==
The right of way was established by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. Eight miles (13 km) of the disused line was purchased by the city of Denton in 1993, with a rail trail opening in 2001.
A formal Alternatives Analysis study conducted in 2004–2005, which included extensive community and citizen involvement, identified the proposed rail line as the best and most cost-effective mobility solution for Denton County and the region. It cited the impacts of projected population growth, growing safety, traffic congestion and air quality concerns, as well as the need to improve access to Denton County's vital health care facilities and three major college and university campuses.
In May 2005, the DCTA Board of Directors approved the study's recommendation to construct the rail alignment on east side of I-35E using an existing railroad corridor. The DCTA worked closely with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to meet the Federal and local regulatory requirements. In March 2008, the DCTA Board of Directors approved the Final Environmental Impact Determination that detailed the proposed measures to mitigate the environmental impacts of the rail project and the Regional Transportation Council approved funding of in August 2008. Federal funds were not used in the construction of the rail link.
The A-train name, station names, and station locations were publicly revealed in September 2008. DCTA's then-director of transportation services, Dee Leggett, stated that the A-train name "represent[s] Denton's position as the apex of the Dallas/Fort Worth region."
On April 4, 2011, the DCTA began tests of railcars, communications systems and signals on track between Carrollton and Lewisville Lake, with tests on the remainder of the route projected to begin later in the month, though this date was later pushed back to mid-May.
The A-train was opened on June 20, 2011, with celebrations at five train stations.


=== Operators ===
On July 20, 2016, First Transit (the American subsidiary of British transportation operator FirstGroup) signed an agreement with DCTA to operate the A-train starting from October of that year. First had already been the operator for DCTA's bus service since in 2007. The contract would last nine years with a five-year extension option. Local rail operator Rio Grande Pacific was also contracted to provide signaling, dispatching, and track maintenance.
On November 3, 2020, Rio Grande Pacific assumed the operations of the A-train for the remainder of the contract and partnered with Stadler US for the maintenance of rolling stock.


=== Future ===
The North Central Texas Council of Governments Mobility 2045 plan calls for the A-train to be extended south to interchange with the DART Silver Line. As of April 2021, DCTA is in discussions with DART to extend the A-train to Downtown Carrollton as part of an agreement in which DCTA would host a DART Silver Line maintenance center at the existing A-Train Operations and
Maintenance Facility, including track upgrades and a new A-train station at Downtown Carrollton.


== Operation ==


=== Fares ===
Fares are fully integrated with the rest of the DCTA system, with single rides costing $1.50. Two free transit zones exist on the system: between Downtown Denton Transit Center and MedPark, as well as Hebron Station to Trinity Mills.


=== Services ===
Since September 7, 2021, the A-train operates with a 30 minute headway during rush hours and interpeak every weekday, while on Saturdays the service runs every 60 minutes. There is no service on Sundays and major holidays. Interchanges with the DART Green Line are irregularly timed.


=== Stations ===
All stations have a park and ride lot and are fully accessible.


=== Rolling stock ===
DCTA placed an order for 11 Stadler GTW 2/6 DMUs in 2010. The first of the new trains were delivered in late 2011 for testing prior to their entry into service. The full order was fulfilled by August 2012, and in September 2012 the new units replaced the Budd DMUs leased from TRE. The line uses diesel-electric hybrid motive power.

The A-Train began operations using 10 Budd RDC-1s leased from Trinity Railway Express, which were used until DCTA's own purpose-built fleet was delivered.

=== A-train (satellite constellation) ===
The A-train (from Afternoon Train) is a satellite constellation of four Earth observation satellites of varied nationality in Sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude that is slightly variable for each satellite.
The orbit, at an inclination of 98.14°, crosses the equator each day at around 1:30 pm solar time, giving the constellation its name (the "A" stands for "afternoon") and crosses the equator again on the night side of the Earth, at around 1:30 am.
They are spaced a few minutes apart from each other so their collective observations may be used to build high-definition three-dimensional images of Earth's atmosphere and surface.


== Satellites ==


=== Active ===

The train, as of January 2022, consists of three active satellites:

OCO-2, lead spacecraft in formation, replaces the failed OCO and was launched for NASA on July 2, 2014.
GCOM-W1 "SHIZUKU", follows OCO-2 by 11 minutes, launched by JAXA on May 18, 2012.
Aura, a multi-national satellite, lags OCO-2 by 19 minutes, launched for NASA on July 15, 2004.


=== Past ===
PARASOL, launched by CNES on December 18, 2004 and moved to another (lower) orbit on December 2, 2009. PARASOL was deactivated in 2013
CloudSat, launched with CALIPSO on April 28, 2006 and moved to another (lower) orbit on February 22, 2018. Now part of the C-train.
CALIPSO, launched on April 28, 2006, is a joint effort of CNES and NASA. It follows CloudSat by no more than 8.5 seconds. CALIPSO was moved to CloudSat's new orbit in September 2018. It was then part of the C-train with Cloudsat until it was officially decommissioned on August 1, 2023.
Aqua, used to run 4 minutes behind GCOM-W1, launched for NASA on May 4, 2002. In January 2022, it descended from the A-Train to save fuel and now is in a free-drift mode, wherein its equatorial crossing time is slowly drifting to later times.


=== Failed ===
OCO, destroyed by a launch vehicle failure on February 24, 2009, and was replaced by OCO-2.
Glory, failed during launch on a Taurus XL rocket on March 4, 2011, and would have flown between CALIPSO and Aura.

=== A-type asteroid ===
A-type asteroids are relatively uncommon inner-belt asteroids that have a strong, broad 1 μm olivine feature and a very reddish spectrum shortwards of 0.7 μm. They are thought to come from the completely differentiated mantle of an asteroid, and appear to have a high density. One survey found that 7 similar A-, V- and X-type asteroids had an average density of 3.6 g/cm3.


== List ==
A-type asteroids are so rare that as of August 2024, only 17 had been discovered:

=== A-type granite ===
A-type granite is a particular category of the S-I-A-M or 'alphabet' system which classifies granitoids and granitic rock by their protoliths or source.  The 'A' stands for Anorogenic or Anhydrous, as these granites are characterized by low water content and a lack of orogenic or transitional tectonic fabric.  Other SIAM categories are S, I, and M types.


== Alphabet Classification System ==
In mid 1970's Chappell and White established 2 fundamentally distinctive types of granite: rocks with attributes that could be derived from metasedimentary rock, “S-type” granites and those whose attributes derived from metaigneous rock, “I-type” granites.    The addition of the A-type granitoids was proposed by Loiselle and Wones in 1979 however this type was based on tectonic regime and geochemical characteristics.  The later M-type granitoids were based on their mantle-sourced protoliths and of having particular chemical characteristics.


== Occurrence ==
The A-type granites dominantly form within continental intraplate rifting or uplifting or at regional post-orogeny uplift or collapse.  Their formation could be either anorogenic, meaning  far from any orogeny, or after orogeny is completed.


== Geochemistry ==
Chemical characteristics of A-type granites include high silica, alkalis, zirconium, niobium, gallium, yttrium and cerium. The ratio of gallium to aluminium is high, as is the ratio of iron to magnesium. There are lower levels of calcium and strontium.  By using Ga/Al ratio, fractionated felsic I or S-type granites can overlap in apparent composition. Enriched alkalis include sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium. Other depleted elements include barium, phosphorus, titanium and europium.


== Subtypes ==
Subtypes include A1, anorogenic, derived from ocean island basalt; and A2 post-orogenic, derived by crustal melting or crust and mantle mixing.


== Sources ==
The source could be dry granulite left over from the loss of wet magma during orogenies.

=== A-type main-sequence star ===
An A-type main-sequence star (AV) or A dwarf star is a main-sequence (hydrogen burning) star of spectral type A and luminosity class V (five). These stars have spectra defined by strong hydrogen Balmer absorption lines. They measure between 1.4 and 2.1 solar masses (M☉), have surface temperatures between 7,600 and 10,000 K, and live for about a quarter of the lifetime of our Sun. Bright and nearby examples are Altair (A7), Sirius A (A1), and Vega (A0). A-type stars do not have convective zones and thus are not expected to harbor magnetic dynamos. As a consequence, because they do not have strong stellar winds, they lack a means to generate X-ray emissions.


== Spectral standard stars ==

The revised Yerkes Atlas system listed a dense grid of A-type dwarf spectral standard stars, but not all of these have survived to this day as standards. The "anchor points" and "dagger standards" of the MK spectral classification system among the A-type main-sequence dwarf stars, i.e. those standard stars that have remained unchanged over years and can be considered to define the system, are Vega (A0 V), Phecda (A0 V), and Fomalhaut (A3 V). The seminal review of MK classification by Morgan & Keenan (1973) didn't provide any dagger standards between types A3 V and F2 V. HD 23886 was suggested as an A5 V standard in 1978.
Richard Gray & Robert Garrison provided the most recent contributions to the A dwarf spectral sequence in a pair of papers in 1987 and 1989. They list an assortment of fast- and slow-rotating A-type dwarf spectral standards, including HD 45320 (A1 V), HD 88955 (A2 V), 2 Hydri (A7 V), 21 Leonis Minoris (A7 V), and 44 Ceti (A9 V). Besides the MK standards provided in Morgan's papers and the Gray & Garrison papers, one also occasionally sees Zosma (A4 V) listed as a standard. There are no published A6 V and A8 V standard stars. 


== Planets ==
A-type stars are young (typically few hundred million years old) and many emit infrared (IR) radiation beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This IR excess is attributable to dust emission from a debris disk where planets form.
Surveys indicate massive planets commonly form around A-type stars although these planets are difficult to detect using the Doppler spectroscopy method. This is because A-type stars typically rotate very quickly, which makes it difficult to measure the small Doppler shifts induced by orbiting planets since the spectral lines are very broad. However, this type of massive star eventually evolves into a cooler red giant which rotates more slowly and thus can be measured using the radial velocity method. As of early 2011 about 30 Jupiter class planets have been found around evolved K-giant stars including Pollux, Gamma Cephei and Iota Draconis. Doppler surveys around a wide variety of stars indicate about 1 in 6 stars having twice the mass of the Sun are orbited by one or more Jupiter-sized planets, compared to about 1 in 16 for Sun-like stars.

A-type star systems known to feature planets include HD 15082, Beta Pictoris, HR 8799 and HD 95086.


== Examples ==
Within 40 light years:

Delta Capricorni is likely a subgiant or giant star, and Altair is a disputed subgiant.  In addition, Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky.

=== A-type proanthocyanidin ===
A type proanthocyanidins are a specific type of proanthocyanidins, which are a class of flavonoid. Proanthocyanidins fall under a wide range of names in the nutritional and scientific vernacular, including oligomeric proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, polyphenols, condensed tannins, and OPCs. Proanthocyanidins were first popularized by French scientist Jacques Masquelier.


== Distribution in plants ==

A-type linkage is a less common feature in proanthocyanidins with both 4β→8 (B-type) and 2β→O→7 interflavanoid bonds.
A-type proanthocyanidin glycosides can be isolated from cocoa liquor.


=== Dimers ===
Procyanidin A1 is an epicatechin-(2β→7,4β→8)-catechin dimer.
Procyanidin A2 is a dimeric (-)epicatechin.
Other A-type proanthocyanidins can be found in cranberries, cinnamon, peanut skins and Geranium niveum.


== Chemistry ==
B-type procyanidins (catechin dimers) can be converted to A-type procyanidins by radical oxidation. Fragmentation patterns for A-type proanthocyanidins include heterocyclic ring fission (HRF), retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) fission, benzofuran-forming fission (BFF) and quinone methide fission (QM).


== Metabolism ==
The metabolism of type-A proanthocyanidins is significant since a large number of metabolites are detected in urine and feces soon after ingestion of foods rich in polymers, indicating rapid elimination and absence of physiological effect. Polymeric type-A proanthocyanidins are depolymerized into epicatechin units in the small intestine, then cleaved into smaller phenolic acids with no known biological role.


== Research ==
In vitro, A-type proanthocyanidins isolated from cranberry juice cocktail demonstrated anti-adhesion activity against E. coli binding to urinary tract epithelial cells, whereas B-type proanthocyanidins from grape exhibited minor activity. In humans, a 2014 review indicated there was insufficient clinical evidence that cranberry type-A proanthocyanidins are effective in lowering the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs), while a 2023 review concluded that long-term consumption of cranberry products may reduce the risk of UTIs in certain groups.

=== A-unit ===
An A-unit, in railroad terminology, is a diesel locomotive (or more rarely an electric locomotive) equipped with a driving cab and a control system to control other locomotives in a multiple unit, and therefore able to be the lead unit in a consist of several locomotives controlled from a single position. This terminology is generally used in North America, since only there was it commonplace to build B-units—cabless locomotive units which normally could not lead a train.


== Typical features ==
Typical driving cab features, and therefore A-unit features, include windshields, rectangular side windows, crew seats, heating, and sometimes, radios, air conditioning and toilets. B-units always lack all of these features, except that some EMD F-units have an extra porthole-style side window(s) for a hostler (an employee permitted to move a locomotive in a yard only, not on the road).


== Terminology ==
This terminology has fallen out of use for newer locomotives, since it only really applied to the cab unit style of locomotive. Thus, the term cab unit is used only when an A-unit has a carbody design. Hood unit "road switcher" types were generally equipped with driving cabs and the term "A-unit" was not generally applied to them, although the rare cabless road switchers were still called B-units.


== Conversions ==
In some cases, A-units were converted to B-units. If the unit had been involved in a collision which damaged the cab, it was sometimes more cost-effective to rebuild the unit without the cab. In rarer cases, B-units were converted to A-units. The Chicago and North Western Railway converted several E8B units purchased from the Union Pacific Railroad. The cabs on the rebuilt units were referred to as "Crandall Cabs." The BNSF also experimented with a single GP60B to make it an A-unit by using an Ex-UP SD40-2 cab on a GP60B frame and body, also  required to move was the Dynamic blister from the front of the unit to the middle of the unit to make room for the cab.

=== A-weighting ===
A-weighting is a form of frequency weighting and the most commonly used of a family of curves defined in the International standard IEC 61672:2003 and various national standards relating to the measurement of sound pressure level. A-weighting is applied to instrument-measured sound levels in an effort to account for the relative loudness perceived by the human ear, as the ear is less sensitive to low audio frequencies.  It is employed by arithmetically adding a table of values, listed by octave or third-octave bands, to the measured sound pressure levels in dB. The resulting octave band measurements are usually added (logarithmic method) to provide a single A-weighted value describing the sound; the units are written as dB(A).  Other weighting sets of values – B, C, D and now Z – are discussed below.
The curves were originally defined for use at different average sound levels, but A-weighting, though originally intended only for the measurement of low-level sounds (around 40 phon), is now commonly used for the measurement of environmental noise and industrial noise, as well as when assessing potential hearing damage and other noise health effects at all sound levels; indeed, the use of A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for all these measurements, because decades of field experience have shown a good correlation with occupational deafness in the frequency range of human speech. It is also used when measuring low-level noise in audio equipment, especially in the United States. In Britain, Europe and other parts of the world, broadcasters and audio engineers more often use the ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which was developed in the 1960s based on research by the BBC and other organizations.  This research showed that our ears respond differently to random noise, and the equal-loudness curves on which the A, B and C weightings were based are really only valid for pure single tones.


== History ==
A-weighting began with work by Fletcher and Munson which resulted in their publication, in 1933, of a set of equal-loudness contours. Three years later these curves were used in the first American standard for sound level meters. This ANSI standard, later revised as ANSI S1.4-1981, incorporated B-weighting as well as the A-weighting curve, recognising the unsuitability of the latter for anything other than low-level measurements. But B-weighting has since fallen into disuse. Later work, first by Zwicker and then by Schomer, attempted to overcome the difficulty posed by different levels, and work by the BBC resulted in the CCIR-468 weighting, currently maintained as ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which gives more representative readings on noise as opposed to pure tones.


== Deficiencies ==
A-weighting is valid to represent the sensitivity of the human ear as a function of the frequency of pure tones. The A-weighting was based on the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curves, which represented an early determination of the equal-loudness contour for human hearing. However, because decades of field experience have shown a good correlation between the A scale and occupational deafness in the frequency range of human speech, this scale is employed in multiple jurisdictions to evaluate the risks of occupational deafness and other auditory problems related to signals or speech intelligibility in noisy environments.
Because of perceived discrepancies between early and more recent determinations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) revised its standard curves as defined in ISO 226, in response to the recommendations of a study coordinated by the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies, by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and USA. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.) This resulted in the acceptance of a new set of curves standardized as ISO 226:2003 (subsequently revised again in 2023 with changes to the ISO 226 equal loudness contours of less than 0.5 dB over the 20-90 phon range). The report comments on the large differences between the combined study results and the original Fletcher–Munson equal loudness contours, as well as the later Robinson-Dadson contours that formed the basis for the first version of ISO 226, published in 1987. Subsequent research has demonstrated that A-weighting is in closer agreement with the updated 60-phon contour incorporated into ISO 226:2003 than with the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson contour, which challenges the common misapprehension that A-weighting represents loudness only for quiet sounds.
Nevertheless, A-weighting would be a closer match to the equal loudness curves if it fell more steeply above 10 kHz, and it is conceivable that this compromise may have arisen because steep filters were more difficult to construct in the early days of electronics. Nowadays, no such limitation need exist, as demonstrated by the ITU-R 468 curve. If A-weighting is used without further band-limiting it is possible to obtain different readings on different instruments when ultrasonic, or near ultrasonic noise is present. Accurate measurements therefore require a 20 kHz low-pass filter to be combined with the A-weighting curve in modern instruments. This is defined in IEC 61012 as AU weighting and while desirable, is rarely fitted to commercial sound level meters.


== B-, C-, D-, G- and Z-weightings ==
A-frequency-weighting is mandated by the international standard IEC 61672 to be fitted to all sound level meters and are approximations to the equal loudness contours given in ISO 226. The old B- and D-frequency-weightings have fallen into disuse, but multiple sound level meters provide for C frequency-weighting and its fitting is mandated — at least for testing purposes — to precision (Class one) sound level meters. D-frequency-weighting was specifically designed for use when measuring high-level aircraft noise in accordance with the IEC 537 measurement standard. The large peak in the D-weighting curve is not a feature of the equal-loudness contours, but reflects the fact that humans hear random noise differently from pure tones, an effect that is particularly pronounced around 6 kHz. This is because individual neurons from different regions of the cochlea in the inner ear respond to narrow bands of frequencies, but the higher frequency neurons integrate a wider band and hence signal a louder sound when presented with noise containing multiple frequencies than for a single pure tone of the same pressure level. 
Following changes to the ISO standard, D-frequency-weighting by itself should now only be used for non-bypass-type jet engines, which are found only on military aircraft and not on commercial aircraft.  For this reason, today A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for light civilian aircraft measurements, while a more accurate loudness-corrected weighting EPNdB is required for certification of large transport aircraft. D-weighting is the basis for the measurement underlying EPNdB.
Z- or ZERO frequency-weighting was introduced in the International Standard IEC 61672 in 2003 and was intended to replace the "Flat" or "Linear" frequency weighting often fitted by manufacturers. This change was needed as each sound level meter manufacturer could choose their own low and high frequency cut-offs (–3 dB) points, resulting in different readings, especially when peak sound level was being measured. It is a flat frequency response between 10 Hz and 20 kHz ±1.5 dB. As well, the C-frequency-weighting, with –3 dB points at 31.5 Hz and 8 kHz did not have a sufficient bandpass to allow the sensibly correct measurement of true peak noise (Lpk).
G-weighting is used for measurements in the infrasound range from 8 Hz to about 40 Hz.
B- and D-frequency-weightings are no longer described in the body of the standard IEC 61672:2003, but their frequency responses can be found in the older IEC 60651, although that has been formally withdrawn by the International Electrotechnical Commission in favour of IEC 61672:2003. The frequency weighting tolerances in IEC 61672 have been tightened over those in the earlier standards IEC 179 and IEC 60651 and thus instruments complying with the earlier specifications should no longer be used for legally required measurements.


== Environmental and other noise measurements ==

A-weighted decibels are abbreviated dB(A) or dBA. When acoustic (calibrated microphone) measurements are being referred to, then the units used will be dB SPL referenced to
20 micropascals = 0 dB SPL.
The A-weighting curve has been adopted for environmental noise measurement, and is standard in a number of sound level meters. The A-weighting system is used in any measurement of environmental noise (examples of which include roadway noise, rail noise, aircraft noise). A-weighting is also in common use for assessing potential hearing damage caused by loud noise, including noise dose measurements at work. A noise level of more than 85 dB(A) each day increases the risk factor for hearing damage.
A-weighted sound power levels LWA are increasingly found on sales literature for domestic appliances such as refrigerators, freezers and computer fans. 
The expected sound pressure level to be measured at a given distance as SPL with a sound level meter can with some simplifications be calculated from the sound power level. 
In Europe, the A-weighted noise level is used for instance for normalizing the noise of tires on cars.
Noise exposure for visitors of venues with loud music is usually also expressed in dB(A), although the presence of high levels of low frequency noise does not justify this.


== Audio reproduction and broadcasting equipment ==

Although the A-weighting curve, in widespread use for noise measurement, is said to have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise. This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of spectral content, each hair cell responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low-frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by the brain to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1 kHz and a downward tilt below 1 kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.
This enhanced sensitivity to noise in the region of 6 kHz became particularly apparent in the late 1960s with the introduction of compact cassette recorders and Dolby-B noise reduction. A-weighted noise measurements were found to give misleading results because they did not give sufficient prominence to the 6 kHz region where the noise reduction was having greatest effect, and did not sufficiently attenuate noise around 10 kHz and above (a particular example is with the 19 kHz pilot tone on FM radio systems which, though usually inaudible, is not sufficiently attenuated by A-weighting, so that sometimes one piece of equipment would even measure worse than another and yet sound better, because of differing spectral content.
ITU-R 468 noise weighting was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness of all types of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by multiple other standards bodies (IEC, BSI) and, as of 2006, is maintained by the ITU. It became widely used in Europe, especially in broadcasting, and was adopted by Dolby Laboratories who realised its superior validity for their purposes when measuring noise on film soundtracks and compact cassette systems. Its advantages over A-weighting are less accepted in the US, where the use of A-weighting still predominates. It is used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.

=== A-wing ===
Kuat RZ-1 A-wing Interceptor are  starfighters in the Star Wars franchise. Designed and manufactured by the Kuat Systems Engineering, they are depicted as fast but fragile interceptors of the Rebel Alliance, conceived for high-speed surgical strikes, deep reconnaissance and escort fighter duty.
A-wings first appear in Return of the Jedi (1983) and later in numerous Star Wars materials and productions. It gained popularity through its depiction in several video games, and since 1985 the A-wing has been merchandised by several companies. They are the fastest vessels in the Star Wars canon, with the advantage of being the smallest hyperspace drive-equipped craft without relying on a carrier, allowing the vessel to extricate itself from a losing battle or escape hostile territory after performing an attack.


== Appearances ==
RZ-1 A-wings from Green Squadron participate in the climactic Battle of Endor depicted in Return of the Jedi (1983). At Endor, an A-wing piloted by Arvel Crynyd (Hilton McRae) crashes into the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer Executor, resulting in the Executor crashing out of control into the second Death Star. In addition to McRae, two women recorded A-wing cockpit footage; one of the actors was cut, and the other was dubbed over by a male actor.
A-wings later appear in various Star Wars Expanded Universe television shows, books, and games. Some Expanded Universe material says Jan Dodonna created the A-wing based on his analysis of the role of speed in the Battle of Yavin, the climactic battle in Star Wars (1977). Later material, such as the Star Wars Rebels television series, depicts the starfighters in use before the events of Star Wars.
The A-wings of Phoenix Squadron play an important role in Rebels' second season (2015–2016). Rebels producers used the A-wing in part because the ship was not used much in Return of the Jedi  The fighter's presence in the cartoon was meant to show that different groups used different craft to fight the Empire. The series's episodes "The Holocrons of Fate" and "Twin Suns" also feature the two-seater RZ-1T trainer, a training spacecraft used by the rebels to train recruits. The RZ-1T also appears in the novel Battlefront II: Inferno Squad.
The RZ-1 A-Wing is based on the R-22 A-Wing, also made by Kuat Systems Engineering.
A later variant, the RZ-2 A-wing, features in Star Wars Battlefront II and in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It is a bigger spacecraft used by the Resistance against the First Order.


== Concept and design ==

The A-wing was one of two new Rebel Alliance starfighters created for Return of the Jedi. It was dubbed the A fighter because it was the first of the two designs created. Ralph McQuarrie's production paintings of A-wing starfighters were completed after filming and displayed alternative blue markings.
Joe Johnston designed the ship, Wesley Seeds and Lorne Peterson of Industrial Light & Magic built the model, and its pilot figure is based on a World War I German airman. A battle-damaged engine "wing" was snapped into place to represent Arvel Crynyd's damaged fighter as it crashed into the Executor.
McQuarrie's alternative blue-and-white coloring was used for the craft's appearance in Rebels. Photographs from the filming of Star Wars: The Last Jedi show an A-wing on the film set. Screen Rant suggests the A-wing seen in the photographs evokes some of McQuarrie's interpretation of the design, such as the blaster cannon shape and the presence of additional ports in the cockpit.


== Depiction ==
According to Star Wars canon, the A-wing was first produced by Kuat Systems Engineering, which had built the Delta-7 starfighter for the Jedi Order.  With the Jedi eradicated (as depicted in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith) and the Delta-7 nearly impossible for non-Jedi to pilot, Kuat designed a new starfighter, the R-22 A-wing, in hopes the Galactic Empire would purchase it.  While impressed with prototypes of the R-22, the Empire instead went with the TIE fighter, and forbade Kuat from mass-producing the A-wing.  The prototypes were sold to the kingdom of Tammuz-an, which over a decade later were eventually sold to the Rebel Alliance. 
Rebel engineers made many alterations to the original R-22 design to produce the RZ-1 model as seen in Return of the Jedi.  The original engines were swapped out for more powerful ones, while other major components were replaced with lightweight versions so a supraluminal hyperdrive could be added.  The resulting fighter is faster than even the Empire's TIE interceptor and perfect for hit-and-run attacks, long-range patrols, and reconnaissance missions.  Its two laser cannons, mounted on special swivel mounts, can elevate or depress 60° vertically; some were modified for full 360° rotation but these had a greater chance to jam. However, engineers could not fit the A-wing with an astromech droid, which limited how many hyperspace coordinates it could carry.  The lack of droid assistance also makes it challenging even for a being with Jedi-like reflexes to control a fighter so fast and maneuverable.  Consequently, only the best Rebel pilots are allowed to fly the A-wing.
After the Empire was defeated, background material explains how Kuat Systems Engineering made a number of improvements to the design to create the RZ-2 A-wing for the New Republic Defense Fleet.  Even faster than the original, the RZ-2 requires less maintenance than the RZ-1, and the swivel mounts that allow its laser cannons to rotate 360° were no longer at risk of jamming.  Thanks to the New Republic's disarmament campaign, RZ-2s found their way into the Resistance, which like the Rebellion before allows only the best pilots to fly the A-wing.


== Impact ==

CinemaBlend said the A-wing received little attention after Return of the Jedi because no prominent characters pilot the craft. Kenner in 1985 released an A-wing pilot figure as part of its Power of the Force line, and it released a "magnificent" A-wing toy as part of the Star Wars: Droids line. Since then, the A-wing has been recreated as various other toys, models, and collectibles by companies that include Galoob, Hasbro, Model Products Corporation, Estes Industries, Lego, and Fantasy Flight Games.
Screen Rant said the A-wing gained popularity as a playable craft in the Star Wars: X-Wing space combat simulator (1993), which The Escapist said depicted the ship as "an excellent dogfighter". Subsequent video games that allowed players to pilot the A-wing also contributed to the ship's popularity. Blastr ranked the A-wing 16th on its list of the best Star Wars vehicles.
Prince Harry was photographed sitting in an A-wing cockpit during his and the Duke of Cambridge's April 2016 visit to the Star Wars: Episode VIII set. Responding to the photographs, various publications called the A-wing "iconic", an "unsung hero", "woefully underappreciated", and "a classic".
In 2018 a number of Star Wars starfighters - including the A-wing - had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the Autodesk Flow Design virtual wind tunnel program.  Of those starfighters tested the A-wing was among the most aerodynamic designs of all with a drag coefficient of .17, though it was still worse than the real-life example of the F-4E Phantom with a .02 rating.  These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that Star Wars fighters can use repulsorlifts and deflector shields to give themselves better flight profiles.

=== A... My Name Is Alice ===
A... My Name Is Alice is a musical revue conceived by Joan Micklin Silver and Julianne Boyd, first produced in 1983. It won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Revue. It consists of some 21 songs by composers such as David Zippel, Doug Katsaros, Winnie Holzman, and Lucy Simon, along with sketches by writers like Anne Meara.


== Production history ==
The revue, a production of The Women's Project, played at "The Top of the Gate" at The Village Gate, New York City, from November 2, 1983, through November 14, 1983, and then opened in the basement space of the American Place Theatre, New York City, on February 24, 1984, through March 11, 1984.  The revue returned to the Top of the Gate in May 1984 and ran for 353 performances.
The original Top of the Gate cast and The American Place Theatre cast both featured Roo Brown, Randy Graff, Mary Gordon Murray, Alaina Reed, and Charlayne Woodard. The revue was directed by Silver and Boyd and choreographed by Yvonne Adrian (Top of the Gate)/Edward Love.


=== Sequels ===
There are two sequels to this revue, both in the revue-sketch format, conceived and directed by Silver and Boyd: 

A...My Name Is Still Alice; premiered at the Old Globe Theatre, San Diego, California, on May 14, 1992; premiered in New York City at The Second Stage Theatre on November 22, 1992.
A...My Name Will Always Be Alice, (also titled Alice Revisited) a combination of the two previous revues. Presented at the Barrington Stage Company, Great Barrington, MA (1995); The American Stage Festival, Milford, NH; and The Orpheum Theatre, Foxborough, MA.


== Revue format and premise ==
The format is that of a musical revue of 20 or so songs and sketches performed by a five-member cast of women of different ages and types in a 'wide variety of situations and relationships with insight, empathy and self-deprecating humour.’ The women have names in some of the sketches and songs, in others they are simply named "first actress", etc.
Each of the cast members introduces herself by reciting an adult update on the children's ABC rhyme. One example: "A ... my name is Alice, And my husband's name is Adam, And his girlfriend's name is Amy, And my lover's name is Abby, And her husband's name is Arnie, And his boyfriend's name is Allan, And my analyst's name is Arthur, And we're working on my anger".

== Critical response ==
Frank Rich, reviewing for The New York Times, calling  the revue "delightful", wrote: "Many of the songs are theater songs in the best sense: The music and lyrics are so sophisticated that they can carry the weight of one-act plays. A song called Friends recounts the entire history of a friendship that sustains two women from high school through marriage and old age; another, titled Sisters, provides a similar account of two women whose lifelong sibling rivalry at last reaches a bittersweet resolution in a lonely apartment in Queens. But even the show's flat-out comic turns can gain in complexity as they go along...the veteran directors who conceived and staged the show, have given it a warm, spontaneous ambiance. Though the performers and the audience share close quarters, the intimacy never becomes oppressive. Michael Skloff's piano accompaniment is spirited, and so are the vestpocket dance routines choreographed by Edward Love. To be sure, A . . . My Name Is Alice is a small-scale entertainment, but you're likely to emerge from its underground home feeling a real lift."

=== A.1. Sauce ===
A.1. Sauce (formerly A.1. Steak Sauce and sometimes stylized as A1 Sauce in certain markets) is a brand of brown sauce produced by Brand & co, a subsidiary of Premier Foods in the United Kingdom (as "Brand's A.1. Sauce") and in North America by Kraft Heinz. Sold from 1831 as a condiment for "fish, meat, fowl and game" dishes in the United Kingdom, the makers introduced the product to Canada, and later to the U.S. where it was later marketed as a steak sauce. 


== History and ownership ==

In 1824, Henderson William Brand, a chef to King George IV of the United Kingdom, created the original  brown sauce on which A.1. is based. A popular myth has it that the king declared it "A.1." and thus, the name was born. The term "A.1." originated as a ship insurance term in the UK to describe a "first rate" ship by Lloyd's of London.
The sauce went into commercial production under the Brand & Co. label in 1831, marketed as a condiment for "fish, meat and fowl", and continued production under this label after bankruptcy forced ownership of Brand & Co. to be transferred to W. H. Withall in 1850. It was renamed A.1. in 1873, after a trademark dispute between creator Henderson William Brand and Dence & Mason, who had since purchased Brand & Co. from Withall. It continued to be produced by Brand & Co. until the late 1970s at the firm's factory in Vauxhall, London until it fell out of favor within the UK domestic market. A.1. brand in the UK was owned by Ranks Hovis McDougall for a time and currently owned by Premier Foods. A.1. Sauce was still, as of June 2020, produced in England and exported to Asia.
A.1. was officially registered as a trademark in the US in 1895, and imported and distributed in the United States by G. F. Heublein & Brothers in 1906. Beginning in the early 1960s, it was marketed in the US as "A.1. Steak Sauce". R. J. Reynolds—which merged with Nabisco in 1985 to form RJR Nabisco—acquired Heublein in 1982. In 1999, Kraft Foods acquired Nabisco, including the licence for the A.1. brand in North America.
In the USA during the 1980s, two new flavors of A.1. were introduced, representing the first expansion of the trademark in North America. These varieties were soon discontinued. In 2000, an A.1. line of marinades was launched. In May 2014, Kraft Foods in North America announced it was dropping the word "steak" from the A.1. name, reverting to A.1. Sauce to "reflect modern dining habits".


== Ingredients ==

A.1. Sauce in the US includes tomato purée, raisin paste, spirit vinegar, corn syrup, salt, crushed orange purée, dried garlic and onions, spice, celery seed, caramel color, potassium sorbate, and xanthan gum. The 'Original' A1 recipe exported to the USA dramatically differs from the versions sold in Canada. A.1. Sauce in Canada includes tomato purée, marmalade, raisins, onions, garlic, malt vinegar, sugar, salt, tragacanth, spices and flavorings.


== Legal action ==
A.1. in the United States was the subject of a trademark dispute between then-owners RJR Nabisco and Arnie Kaye of Westport, Connecticut, whose International Deli was producing and selling its own recipe condiment under the name "A.2. Sauce". In 1991, the United States District Court for Connecticut found in favor of Nabisco.


== Popular culture ==
Rock musician and singer Meat Loaf appeared in a TV commercial for the product, to promote its new slogan: "A.1.—Makes beef sing". In the commercial, the slogan is "Makes Meat Loaf sing", and he sings a very short excerpt from his hit song "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)".

=== A.A.A. Massaggiatrice bella presenza offresi... ===
A.A.A. Massaggiatrice bella presenza offresi...  (lit. 'A.A.A. Masseuse, Good-Looking, Offers Her Services...') is a 1972 Italian giallo film directed by Demofilo Fidani.


== Plot ==
Cristina is working as a call-girl. Her clients are mysteriously and brutally murdered one after another.


== Cast ==
Paola Senatore as Cristina Graziani
Simonetta Vitelli (credited as Simone Blondell) as Paola


== Production ==
The Italian film historian and critic Roberto Curti described A.A.A. Massaggiatrice bella presenza offresi... as being part of a minor wave of low-budget giallo films in second run and third-run venues.
The film"s script was written by director Demofilo Fidani and his wife Mila Vitelli. Unlike most of Fidani's films (predominantly Westerns) in which he is credited under an English alias, the director is credited by his (real) Italian name.


== Genre ==
The Italian database Cinematografo defines the film's subgenre as erotic thriller. The film contains elements of horror and slasher.


== Release ==
A.A.A. Massaggiatrice bella presenza offresi... was released in 1972. At the time of its release in France the same year, the film's version and its title (Caresses à domicile) were noted as "very daring", the film being presented as a mere "erotic film" by La Revue du cinéma or a "porn third-rate production" by Écran'


== Reception ==
From retrospective reviews, Roberto Curti described the film as containing elements of Demofilo Fidani's typical style, specifically Western-type revolvers and villains falling in slow motion in "unlikely acrobatic manners." Antonio Bruschini, of the Italian genre magazine Nocturno, found the ending of the film and the culprit predictable but noted that A.A.A. Massaggiatrice reflected the Argentinean atmosphere of the period.

=== A.A.A (EP) ===
A.A.A is the eponymous debut extended play by Nigerian alternative rock band A.A.A. It was recorded at Blackstar Studios in Ikoyi and released on August 5, 2019. The band is composed of singer Brymo, guitarist Jad Moukarim, drummer Adey Omotade, and bassist Laughter. A.A.A comprises five tracks and is a fusion of folk music, psychedelic rock and African rhythms; it was mixed and mastered by Mikky Me Joses.


== Composition ==
On the folk and rock-tinged opening track "Johnbull", Brymo introduces listeners to a nominal character who left home in search of a better life. Jad Moukarim's electric guitar riff is included in the song, which takes its title from a well-known nursery tale. The rock-infused track "Mary Had an Orgasm" is about a titular lady who ends up having sexual relations with a man she hires to show her around the city. The Lagos Review's Adeola Juwon said the song makes reference to the female genitalia and acknowledged it for being "brazenly explicit". 
In the soulful ballad "Take Me Back to November", Brymo pleads to be taken back to a time when he had the trust of a loved one; the song also depicts a time when his relationship with the person was in good standing. In "Golden Eyes", Brymo is haunted by the ghost of the dead relationship depicted in the previous track. On the closing track "The in-Between", he encourages listeners to keep persevering, pushing and striving.


== Critical reception ==
A.A.A received positive reviews from music critics. A writer for Filter Free Nigeria, who goes by the moniker the Waistbead Whisperer, praised the EP's sound curation, production, thematic style, and lyrics. The Waistbead Whisperer also said the record "carries Brymo away from the enclosure of his usual sound to a slightly more upbeat realm while still maintaining the otherworldliness of his lyrics". Adewojumi Aderemi of Konbini Channels called A.A.A a "universal body of work" and characterized it as a "refreshing exploration of a plethora of sounds that we simply aren't used to hearing". Music critic Michael Kolawole said the EP is a "decent experimental piece and a litmus test that foretells what Brymo’s next project may sound like".
Writing for The Lagos Review, Adeola Juwon praised the production, lyricism, and Brymo's songwriting. Moreover, Juwon said the record "dwells on loss, relationships in their dying stages, and unrequited love".

=== A.A.C. Eagles ===
A.A.C. Eagles is an American soccer team based in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Founded in 1940, the team plays in Region II of the United States Adult Soccer Association, a network of amateur leagues at the fifth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid. They joined the United Premier Soccer League in 2022. However, due to a dispute with league management, the team left for the local Metropolitan Soccer League, and following that league's merger with the National Soccer League to become the Greater Chicago Soccer League, they left for the Premier League where they play as of 2024. 
The team's colors are red and white.


== History ==
The Eagles were formed as an ethnic club by Polish American immigrants to the Chicago area in 1940. Originally known as the Polish American Athletic Club Eagles (PAAC Eagles), the team first played in the National Soccer League of Chicago, and played under that name until 1950, when the team became officially known as the Chicago Eagles. Since then the team has been known by various names, swapping between its earlier names (PAAC Eagles, Chicago Eagles), and newer variants (Chicago American Eagles, Polish Eagles), before settling on its current incarnation in the mid-1990s. The Eagles currently play in the Metropolitan Soccer League, which is a member of the United States Adult Soccer Association Region II group of leagues.
The Eagles have a long and distinguished history of competing in the National Challenge Cup. Having already reached the final stages of the competition during its early years in 1948 and 1949, the Eagles reached the semifinals in 1989, losing on penalties to eventual winners St. Petersburg Kickers, and won the tournament in 1990 in the pre-MLS era, beating the Brooklyn Italians 2–0 in the final thanks to goals from Janusz Kieca and Peter Modrzejewski. Their win in the competition also gave them entry to the 1991 CONCACAF Champions' Cup, where they lost 4–1 on aggregate in the first round to Bermudian club PHC Zebras.
The Eagles qualified for the cup again in 1994, the last all-amateur competition prior to the entrance of teams from Major League Soccer, but lost 2–1 to Bavarian Leinenkugel in the quarterfinals. Since the introduction of professional teams into the cup the Eagles have not fared as well. They lost in the first round to the Chicago Stingers in 1995, lost in the first round again in 2002 to New York Freedom, and lost in the first round for a third time in 2005, this time falling 4–1 to USL Premier Development League side Chicago Fire Premier.
In 2008 the club qualified for their fourth modern U.S. Open Cup, beating the Milwaukee Bavarians and Des Moines Menace Reserves in their regional qualification tournament, but lost 4–0 in the first round to the Pittsburgh Riverhounds of the USL Second Division.
In addition to their USOC triumph in 1990, the Eagles won the USASA Open Cup in 1989 and 2002. They are nine-time Illinois state champions, eleven-time Metropolitan Soccer League Major Division champions, and also sponsored the Chicago Eagles Select which briefly played in the USL Premier Development League in 2001 and 2002.
In 2022 Eagles announced via social media their joining the United Premier Soccer League.
This would only last for the Spring 2022, after which they left for the local Metropolitan Soccer League. When that league merged with the National Soccer League to ultimately form the Greater Chicago Soccer League in 2023, the Eagles chose to play in the Premier Soccer League of Chicagoland.

=== A.A.R.M. ===
"A.A.R.M." is the collective name for the twenty-second and twenty-third episodes of the ninth season of the American comedy television series The Office, as well as the 198th and 199th episode overall. It was also the series' penultimate entry, airing a week before the series finale. It originally aired on NBC on May 9, 2013. This episode guest stars Nora Kirkpatrick, Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, Mark McGrath, Santigold, Jessica St. Clair, and Rachel Crow.
The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) that he needs to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.); the two subsequently hold tryouts for the position. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her son, Phillip, to work, and Dwight thinks that he may be his son. Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) final fears about her husband's love are settled. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) attempts to get on America's Next A Cappella Sensation, but is not able to audition. Finally, all the members of the office gather at Poor Richard's Pub and watch the airing of the official in-series documentary.
"A.A.R.M." features a dramatic scene in which Jim presents a DVD of the highlights of his relationship with Pam, topped with him finally presenting her with a card he wrote in the second season episode "Christmas Party". The idea to have Jim finally give Pam his card had been considered in the writers' room for some time, but only during "A.A.R.M." did the writers feel it was the right time. In addition, the episode contained several scenes that were purposely staged to be reminiscent of past episodes of the series, with scenes mimicking unique shots in both the third season installment "Gay Witch Hunt" and the sixth season episode "The Delivery".
The episode was also viewed by 4.56 million viewers and received a 2.3/6 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking third in its timeslot, making it the highest-rated episode of the season since the earlier entry "The Boat". "A.A.R.M." received largely positive reviews from critics. The interaction between Jim, Pam, and Dwight received particular praise; many were particularly pleased with the call-back to "Christmas Party". Andy's audition subplot, however, was highly panned.


== Plot ==
Jim Halpert convinces regional manager Dwight Schrute that he needs to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.). Jim designs several Dwight-oriented challenges as tryouts for the position, and it is inevitably found that Dwight is the most qualified. Angela Martin is forced to bring her child, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has been eating the type of paper which Dwight himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is his. To test this theory, Dwight offers the child either a check for one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet. Dwight tells Angela that he will marry her if the child is his, but she denies that this is the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, asking whether he should propose to Angela or his girlfriend Esther, whom he thinks is the more logical choice. Jim tells Dwight that he needs to put aside logic and follow his instincts. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela reveals to Dwight that Phillip is his son, explaining that she lied about his parentage in order to test Dwight's feelings for her.
Darryl Philbin returns to Scranton, after quietly quitting a week ago to work full-time at Athlead, the sports marketing company that Jim founded. When the others spot him, they are upset that he left without saying goodbye and demand to spend some time with him before he leaves for good. They ultimately decide on one final dance together. Everyone has a fun time, and Darryl is glad he got to say a real goodbye.
When Darryl runs into Pam Halpert, he tells her about the company's success and how Jim is missing out by staying in Scranton. Pam begins to worry that she is making Jim do something that he does not want to do. She confronts her husband and admits that she thinks she might not be good enough for him. He asks for the in-series documentary crew's help; the crew makes a DVD of the highlights that they have collected of Jim and Pam's relationship. The final scene that they use is from the second season Christmas episode "Christmas Party," in which Jim gives Pam a teapot but takes back his accompanying card. After Pam watches the DVD, Jim presents her with the still-unopened card. She reads it, and the two happily embrace.
Andy Bernard, who had quit his job in the previous episode, auditions for America's Next A Cappella Sensation. However, before he is able to try out, the judges close the auditions, sending home the remaining applicants, who have been standing in line for hours. Refusing to accept this, he bolts past security and demands the judges let him audition. When they refuse, he throws a crying tantrum. Later, he journeys to Poor Richard's Pub, where he meets his former office workers and is the tie-breaking vote to turn the TVs to the official airing of their documentary on PBS's Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV, rather than college baseball. All together, the office watches the opening of the pilot.


== Production ==

"A.A.R.M." was written by executive producer Brent Forrester, marking his eleventh writing credit for the series, his first since the earlier season episode, "Work Bus". It was directed by regular Office editor David Rogers, marking his ninth directing credit, and first since the earlier season episode "Junior Salesman". The episode was originally supposed to air as a half-hour episode, but NBC later announced it would be expanded to fill an hour time slot. Unlike the previous episodes that were expanded, like "Moving On" and "Livin' the Dream", "A.A.R.M." counts as two produced episodes.
This episode guest stars Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, Mark McGrath, Santigold, and Jessica St. Clair. In order to get them, the show reached out to "a small group of celebrities that [the producers] thought would be good". Both Aiken and Santigold accepted. Baumgartner then asked Rodgers, who was a friend, and he accepted. McGrath later became available, and he was chosen as well. Angela's son, Phillip, was played by twins Vince and Evan Edwards. The child that filmed the scene in which Phillip picked the beet was only supposed to point to the beet. In the end, the child said "beet!", which Rogers called "amazing". The voice of the documentarian that responds to Jim is that of episode director David Rogers. Rogers also voiced the same character in the season opener "New Guys". Originally, showrunner and series creator Greg Daniels had re-recorded the line in "New Guys", but ended up liking Rogers' voice better. He asked him to reprise the role in "A.A.R.M." to preserve continuity.
Jules Kmetzko designed the portraits of Dwight and Mose, as well as Dwight's propaganda picture. He had previously created Pam's watercolor of Dunder Mifflin that hung on the walls. All of the dance moves were choreographed by Mary Ann Kellogg, who had choreographed many of the series' dance-heavy episodes. The obstacle course in the warehouse was crafted by Rogers and Forrester, with input from the show's art department. Wilson also helped, since he eventually was the one who ran through it; it was his idea to have the course terminate on a raised pallet of boxes. Originally, the course was supposed to be in the parking lot, but Rogers moved it, feeling that the warehouse was "more organic" and that the heat would have been detrimental to the finished product. The idea to have Jim finally give Pam his card had been considered in the writers' room for some time, but only during "A.A.R.M." did the writers feel it was the right time. The card and envelope was the same one used for "Christmas Party" almost seven years prior. In fact, the card contained a genuine message that Krasinski wrote for Fischer. Rogers admitted that the Pam and Jim video was inspired by a number of fan videos that exist on the internet. The reason that "Open Your Eyes" by Snow Patrol plays over the video is that Claire Scanlon, the series editor, felt that it was similar in style to "Sing" by Travis, which played in the second season episode "The Client".
The episode contained several scenes that were reminiscent of past episodes of the series. The shot in which Jim and Dwight survey the office was filmed to be similar to a scene that featured Dwight and Michael in the third season installment "Gay Witch Hunt". In addition, Dwight pulling Angela over was filmed in a way that recalled the sixth season episode "The Delivery". Although the scene wherein Jim gives advice to Dwight was shot in a similar manner to Jim's farewell to Michael in the seventh season episode "Goodbye, Michael", it was not intentionally supposed to look like it, according to Rogers. In addition, the obstacle course was not a direct reference to the second season episode "Office Olympics", although Rogers understood that there were similarities.


== Cultural references ==
Jim references both Michael J. Fox and the 1985 film Back to the Future during his "nonsense" conference room meeting. Dwight realizes that Phillip is his son after the child looks at a small-scale replica of the Battlestar Galactica, fictional ship from the science fiction series of the same name, in the same way that Dwight does. Dwight's test to see if Phillip is his son has been compared to a similar scene in the 1997 film Kundun, in which Tibetan monks practice a similar ritual. To win over Kevin, Angela and Oscar pretend that baby Phillip presented him with a used iTunes gift card. Darryl and the rest of the office dance to the song "Boogie Wonderland" by Earth, Wind, and Fire. The show Andy auditions for America's Next A Cappella Sensation, is a parody of popular singing shows like American Idol, The Voice, and The Sing-Off. The fictional show is hosted by Mark McGrath, the lead singer from the rock band Sugar Ray. The judges for the show include Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, and Santigold. Rodgers is an American football quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, Aiken is a singer who gained prominence following the second season of American Idol in 2003, and Santigold is an American singer, songwriter, and producer. Andy sings both the Cornell University alma mater ("Far Above Cayuga's Waters"), as well as "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from the musical Annie. The woman auditioning that he interrupts is Rachel Crow, who achieved fame after competing in season one of The X-Factor.

=== Reviews ===

Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the episode a positive review, and wrote that "as a quasi-finale, 'A.A.R.M.' was surprisingly ... terrific in most areas." He particularly enjoyed the interaction between Jim and Dwight, calling it "so much fun"; he argued that the show would have probably fared better following Steve Carell's departure had the power dynamic and relationship between Jim and Dwight that was explored in "A.A.R.M." been established earlier in the eighth season. He concluded that "The best parts of 'A.A.R.M.' felt like a fitting close to the non-documentary-viewing portion of the series." M. Giant of Television Without Pity was pleased with the episode, and awarded it an "A" grade, the first for the series since "Goodbye, Michael" almost two seasons ago. Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote that the episode "was full of emotional moments that seemed like love letters to the fans who have watched the show since the pilot." Mullins also praised the scenes between Jim and Pam, noting that "we collapsed in tears because the couple we've been rooting for ... can still find ways to make us cry."
Nick Campbell of TV.com felt that the episode was "a decent if uneven penultimate episode that gave us one last look at this quirky group of people in their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I,  [sic] have to admit, I love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell felt that the episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a "great" episode. She wrote that "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter "a slice of bliss".
Erik Adams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a "B+". He said that "what benefits 'AARM' most ... is a back-to-basics Jim-and-Dwight storyline" that illustrated the growth that the characters have experienced in the last nine years. He wrote that there were many tender moments in the episode, such as Dwight and Jim's confrontation, Pam and Jim's reaffirmation of love, and Dwight's proposal to Angela. He concluded that "It's that blend of new beginnings and closing circles that makes 'AARM' an effective second-to-last chapter of The Office". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four-and-a-half stars out of five, and wrote that the episode "didn't disappoint". He called "the scene in which Pam was watching the docu-created montage just as Jim was giving Dwight love advice" the "most emotionally rewarding moment on The Office since Michael Scott's goodbye."
Many critics were extremely pleased with the call back to the teapot and Jim's note from "Christmas Party". Adams felt that the scene, before the reveal of the note, was properly executed, and that the note made it even better. Sepinwall called it "a fabulous payoff for longtime fans". Cornet called the sequence "effective". Rick Porter of Zap2it wrote that it was a "nice move" on the part of the writers for "not letting us know what Jim wrote on the card from 'Christmas Party' [because] it has to be pretty epic."
Conversely, most critics gave Andy's plot a negative review. Sepinwall called the entire plot "godawfulness". Campbell referred to it as "a mediocre story that stood in stark contrast to the emotional timbre of the rest of the episode". Cornet called the scenes "just as disconnected from the core of the show as that character has for some time now." Porter wrote that "the show never quite got a handle on what to do with the character this season", and his subplot in "A.A.R.M." was the culmination of this issue.
